<h1>More Widgets</h1>


<p>This chapter carries on introducing several more widgets: listbox, scrollbar, text, 
scale, spinbox, and progressbar.  Some of these are starting to be a bit more powerful than the basic ones
we looked at before.  Here we'll also see a few instances of using the classic Tk widgets, in
cases where there isn't (or there isn't a need for) a themed counterpart.</p>


 <a name="listbox"></a><h2>Listbox</h2>

<ul class=menu>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tkdocs.com/widgets/listbox.html">Widget Roundup</a></li>

</ul>

<p>A <b>listbox</b> widget displays a list of single-line text items, usually lengthy, and allows users
to browse through the list, selecting one or more.</p>

<p>Listboxes are part of the classic Tk widgets; there is not presently a listbox in the
themed Tk widget set.</p>

<div class=tip><p>Tk's treeview widget (which is themed) can also be used as a listbox (a one level deep tree),
allowing you to use icons and styles with the list.  It's also likely that a multi-column
(table) list widget will make it into Tk at some point, whether based on treeview or one of the available
extensions.</p></div>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/w_listbox_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Listbox widgets.</p>



<div class=python><p>Listboxes are created using the <code><b>Listbox</b></code> class. A height configuration option can specify the number of lines the listbox will display at a time without scrolling:</p>
	<pre>l = Listbox(<em>parent</em>, height=10)</pre></div>

<h3>Populating the Listbox Items</h3>

<p>There's an easy way and a hard way to populate and manage all the items in the listbox.  </p>

<p>Here's the easy way.  Each listbox has a <code>listvariable</code> configuration option, which allows you to 
link a variable (which must hold a list) to the listbox.  Each element of this list
is a string representing one item in the listbox.  To add, remove, or rearrange
items in the listbox, you can simply modify this variable as you would any other
list.  Similarly, to find out, e.g., which item is on the third line of the listbox, just
look at the third element of the list variable.</p>

<div class=python>
It's actually not quite <em>that</em> easy. Tkinter doesn't allow you to link regular Python lists to a <code>listbox</code>.
As we saw with widgets like <code>entry</code>, we need to use a <code>StringVar</code> as an intermediary. It provides a
mapping between Python's lists and a string representation that the underlying Tk widgets can use. It also means that anytime we change the list, we need to update the <code>StringVar</code>.
<pre>
choices = ["apple", "orange", "banana"]
choicesvar = StringVar(value=choices)
l = Listbox(parent, listvariable=choicesvar)
...
choices.append("peach")
choicesvar.set(choices)
</pre>
</div>

<p>The older, harder way to do things is to use a set of methods that are part of the listbox
widget itself. They operate on the (internal) list of items maintained by the widget:</p>

<ul>
<li> The <code>insert <em>idx</em> <em>item</em> <em>?item...?</em></code> method is used to add one or more items
	 to the list; <code><em>idx</em></code> is a 0-based index indicating the position of the item before
	 which the item(s) should be added; specify <code>end</code> to put the new items at the end of
	 the list.
<li> Use the <code>delete <em>first</em> <em>?last?</em></code> method to delete one or more items from the
	 list; <code><em>first</em></code> and <code><em>last</em></code> are indices as per the <code>insert</code> method.
<li> Use the <code>get <em>first</em> <em>?last?</em></code> method to return the contents of a single item at the 
	 given position, or a list of the items between <code><em>first</em></code> and <code><em>last</em></code>.
<li> The <code>size</code> method returns the number of items in the list.
</ul>

<h3>Selecting Items</h3>

<p>You can choose whether users can select only a 
single item at a time from the <code>listbox</code>, or if multiple items can simultaneously be selected.  This is 
controlled by the <code>selectmode</code> option: the default is only being able to select
a single item (<code>browse</code>), while a <code>selectmode</code> of <code>extended</code> allows users to select 
multiple items.</p>

<div class=yuck><p>The names <code>browse</code> and <code>extended</code>, again for backward compatibility reasons, are truly awful.  
This is made worse by the fact that there are two other modes, <code>single</code> and <code>multiple</code>, which 
you <b>should not use</b> (they use an old interaction style that is inconsistent with modern
user interface and platform conventions).</p></div>

<p>To find out which item or items in the listbox are currently selected, use the <code>curselection</code>
method. It returns a list of indices of all items currently selected; this may be an
empty list. For lists with a <code>selectmode</code> of <code>browse</code>, it will never be longer than one item.  You
can also use the <code>selection_includes <em>index</em></code> method to check if the item with the given 
index is currently selected.</p>

<div class=python><pre>if lbox.selection_includes(2): ...</pre></div>

<p>To programmatically change the selection, you can use the <code>selection_clear <em>first</em> <em>?last?</em></code>
method to deselect either a single item or any within the range of indices specified.  To select
an item or all items in a range, use the <code>selection_set <em>first</em> <em>?last?</em></code> method.  Both of 
these will not touch the selection of any items outside the range specified.</p>

<p>If you change the selection, you should also make sure that the newly selected item is visible
 (i.e., it is not scrolled out of view).  To do this, use the <code>see <em>index</em></code> method.</p>

<div class=python><pre>lbox.selection_set(idx)
lbox.see(idx)</pre></div>


<p>When a user changes the selection, a <code>&lt;&lt;ListboxSelect&gt;&gt;</code> virtual event is generated.
You can bind to this to take any action you need.  Depending on your application, you may also want to bind
to a double-click <code>&lt;Double-1&gt;</code> event and use it to invoke an action with the currently selected item.</p>

<div class=python><pre>lbox.bind("&lt;&lt;ListboxSelect&gt;&gt;", lambda e: updateDetails(lbox.curselection()))
lbox.bind("&lt;Double-1&gt;", lambda e: invokeAction(lbox.curselection()))</pre></div>


<h3>Stylizing the List</h3>

<p>Like most of the "classic" Tk widgets, you have immense flexibility in modifying the appearance of a listbox.
As described in the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/listbox.htm">reference manual</a>, you can
modify the font the listbox items are displayed in, the foreground (text) and background colors for items
in their normal state, when selected, when the widget is disabled, etc.  There is also an
<code>itemconfigure</code> method that allows you to change the foreground and background colors of
individual items.</p>

<p>As is often the case, restraint is useful.  Generally, the default values will be entirely suitable and a 
good match for platform conventions.  In the example we'll get to momentarily, we'll show how restrained
use of these options can be put to good effect, in this case displaying alternate lines of the listbox in
slightly different colors.</p>


<h3>Keeping Extra Item Data</h3>

<p>The <code>listvariable</code> (or the internal list, if you're managing things the old way) holds 
the strings that will be shown in the listbox.  It's often the case, though, that each string you're displaying is
associated with some other data item. This might bean internal object that is meaningful to your program, but not
meant to be displayed to users. In other words, what you're really interested in is not so much the string
displayed in the listbox, but the associated data item.  For example, a listbox may display a list of names
to users, but your program is really interested in the underlying user object (or id number)
for each one, not the particular name.  </p>

<p>How can we associate this underlying value with the name that is displayed?  Unfortunately, the listbox widget itself doesn't
offer any facilities, so it's something we'll have to manage separately.  There are a couple of obvious
approaches.  First, if the displayed strings are guaranteed unique, you could use a hash table to map each
name to its associated underlying object.  This wouldn't work well for peoples' names, where
duplicates are possible, but could work for countries, which are unique.</p>

<p>A second approach is to keep a second list, parallel to the list of strings displayed in the listbox.
This second list will hold the underlying object associated with each item that is displayed.
So the first item in the displayed strings list corresponds to the first item in
the underlying objects list, the second to the second, etc.  Any changes that you make in one list (insert, delete,
reorder), you must make in the other.  You can then easily map from the displayed list item to the underlying
object, based on their position in the list.</p>


<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Here is a silly example showing several of these listbox techniques.  We'll have a list of countries
displayed.  We'll be able to select only a single country at a time. As we do so, a status bar will display the population of the country.  
You can press a button to send one of several gifts to the selected country's head of state (well, not really, but use your imagination).
Sending a gift can also be triggered by double-clicking the list or hitting the Return key.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, we maintain two lists in parallel. The first is a list of two-letter country codes. The other is the corresponding name
  for each country that we will display in the listbox. We also have a simple hash table that contains the population of each country, indexed by 
  the two-letter country code.</p>

<p>One obvious thing missing from this example was that while the list of countries could be quite
long, only part of it fits on the screen at once.  To show countries further down in the list, you
had to either drag with your mouse or use the down arrow key.  A scrollbar would have been nice.
Let's fix that.</p>


 <a name="scrollbar"></a><h2>Scrollbar</h2>

<ul class=menu>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tkdocs.com/widgets/scrollbar.html">Widget Roundup</a></li>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/ttk_scrollbar.htm">Reference Manual</a></li>
</ul>


<p>A <b>scrollbar</b> widget helps users see all parts of another widget, whose content is typically
much larger than what can be shown in the available screen space.</p>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/w_scrollbar_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Scrollbar widgets.</p>


<div class=python><p>Scrollbars are created using the <code><b>ttk.Scrollbar</b></code> class:</p>
	<pre>s = ttk.Scrollbar( <em>parent</em>, orient=VERTICAL, command=listbox.yview)
listbox.configure(yscrollcommand=s.set)</pre>
</div>


<p>Unlike in some user interface toolkits, Tk scrollbars are not a part of another widget (e.g., a listbox), but are a
separate widget altogether.  Instead, scrollbars communicate with the <em>scrolled widget</em> by calling
methods on the scrolled widget; as it turns out, the scrolled widget also needs to call methods 
on the scrollbar.  </p>


<p>The <code>orient</code> configuration option determines whether the scrollbar will 
scroll the scrolled widget in the <code>horizontal</code> or <code>vertical</code> dimension.  You then need to use the
<code>command</code> configuration option to specify how to communicate with the scrolled widget.  This is the 
method to call on the scrolled widget when the scrollbar moves.</p>

<p>Every widget that can be scrolled vertically includes a method named <code>yview</code>, while those that
can be scrolled horizontally have a method named <code>xview</code>).  As long as this method is
present, the scrollbar doesn't need to know anything else about the scrolled widget.  When the
scrollbar is manipulated, it appends several parameters to the method call, indicating
how it was scrolled, to what position, etc.</p>

<p>The scrolled widget also needs to communicate back to the scrollbar, telling it what percentage
of the entire content area is now visible.  Besides the <code>yview</code> and/or <code>xview</code> methods,
every scrollable widget also has a <code>yscrollcommand</code> and/or <code>xscrollcommand</code>
configuration option.  This is used to specify a method call, which must be the scrollbar's
<code>set</code> method.  Again, additional parameters will be automatically tacked onto the method
call.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Listboxes are one of several types of widgets that are scrollable.  Here, we'll build a very simple user
interface, consisting of a vertically scrollable listbox that takes up the entire window, with
just a status line at the bottom.</p>

<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/scrollbar_l.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Scrolling a listbox.</p>

<div class=python><pre>from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk

root = Tk()
l = Listbox(root, height=5)
l.grid(column=0, row=0, sticky=(N,W,E,S))
s = ttk.Scrollbar(root, orient=VERTICAL, <b>command=l.yview</b>)
s.grid(column=1, row=0, sticky=(N,S))
<b>l['yscrollcommand'] = s.set</b>
ttk.Label(root, text="Status message here", anchor=(W)).grid(column=0, columnspan=2, row=1, sticky=(W,E))
root.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight=1)
root.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight=1)
for i in range(1,101):
    l.insert('end', 'Line %d of 100' % i)
root.mainloop()</pre></div>



 <a name="text"></a><h2>Text</h2>

<ul class=menu>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tkdocs.com/widgets/text.html">Widget Roundup</a></li>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/text.htm">Reference Manual</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A <b>text</b> widget provides users with an area so that they can enter multiple lines of text.
Text widgets are part of the classic Tk widgets, not the themed Tk widgets.<br>&nbsp;</p>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/w_text_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Text widgets.</p>


<div class=python>	<p>Text widgets are created using the <code><b>Text</b></code> class:</p>
  <pre>t = Text(<em>parent</em>, width=40, height=10)</pre></div>

<p>The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> options specify the requested screen size of the text 
widget, in characters and rows, respectively.  The contents of the text can be arbitrarily large.
You can use the <code>wrap</code> configuration option to control how line wrapping is handled:
values are <code>none</code> (no wrapping, text may horizontally scroll), <code>char</code> (wrap at any
character), and <code>word</code> (wrapping will only occur at word boundaries).</p>

<p>A text widget can be disabled so that no editing can occur. Because text is not a themed widget,
the usual <code>state</code> and <code>instate</code> methods are not available.  Instead, use the
configuration option <code>state</code>, setting it to either <code>disabled</code> or <code>normal</code>.</p>

<div class=python><pre>txt['state'] = 'disabled'</pre></div>


<p>Scrolling works the same way as in listboxes.  The <code>xscrollcommand</code> and <code>yscrollcommand</code>
configuration options attach the text widget to horizontal and/or vertical scrollbars,
and the <code>xview</code> and <code>yview</code> methods are called from scrollbars.
To ensure that a given line is visible (i.e., not scrolled out of view), you can use the <code>see <em>index</em></code>
method, where <code><em>index</em></code> is in the form <code><em>linenum.charnum</em></code>, e.g.,
<code>5.0</code> for the first (0-based) character of line 5 (1-based). </p>


<h3>Contents</h3>

<p>Text widgets do not have a linked variable associated with them like, for example, entry widgets do.
To retrieve the contents of the entire text widget, call the method <code>get 1.0 end</code>; the <code>1.0</code>
is an index into the text, and means the first character of the first line, and <code>end</code> is a shortcut
for the index of the last character in the last line.  Other indices could be provided to retrieve smaller ranges of
text if needed.</p>

  
<p>Text can be added to the widget using the <code>insert <em>index</em> <em>string</em></code> method; again <code><em>index</em></code>
is in the form <code><em>line.char</em></code> and marks the character before which text is inserted; use <code>end</code> 
to add text to the end of the widget.  You can delete a range of text using the <code>delete <em>start</em> <em>end</em></code>
method, where both <code><em>start</em></code> and <code><em>end</em></code> are text indices as already described.</p>

<p>We'll get into the text widget's many additional advanced features in a later chapter.</p>



 <a name="scale"></a><h2>Scale</h2>

<ul class=menu>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tkdocs.com/widgets/scale.html">Widget Roundup</a></li>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/ttk_scale.htm">Reference Manual</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A <b>scale</b> widget allows users to choose a numeric value through direct manipulation.<br>&nbsp;</p>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/w_scale_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Scale widgets.</p>


<div class=python><p>Scale widgets are created using the <code><b>ttk.Scale</b></code> class:</p>
	<pre>s = ttk.Scale(<em>parent</em>, orient=HORIZONTAL, length=200, from_=1.0, to=100.0)</pre>
	<div class=tip><p>Because 'from' is a reserved keyword in Python, we need to add a trailing underscore when using it as a configuration option.</p></div>
</div>


<p>The <code>orient</code> option may be either <code>horizontal</code> or <code>vertical</code>.  The <code>length</code>
option, which represents the longer axis of either horizontal or vertical scales, is specified in screen
units (e.g., pixels).  You should also define the range of the number that 
the scale allows users to choose; to do this, set a floating-point number for each of the 
<code>from</code> and <code>to</code> configuration options.</p>

<p>There are several different ways you can set the current value of the scale (which must be a floating-point
value between the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> values).  
You can set (or read, to get the current value)
the scale's <code>value</code> configuration option.  You can link the scale to a variable using the <code>variable</code>
option.  Or, you can call the scale's <code>set <em>value</em></code> method to change the value, or the <code>get</code>
method to read the current value.</p>

<p>A <code>command</code> configuration option lets you specify a script to call whenever the
scale is changed.  Tk will append the current value of the scale as a parameter each time it
calls this script (we saw a similar thing with extra parameters being added to scrollbar callbacks).</p>

<div class=python><pre><em># label tied to the same variable as the scale, so auto-updates</em>
num = StringVar()
ttk.Label(root, textvariable=num).grid(column=0, row=0, sticky='we')

<p>As with other themed widgets, you can use the <code>state disabled</code>, <code>state !disabled</code>, and
<code>instate disabled</code> methods to prevent users from modifying the scale.</p>

<div class=tip><p>As the scale widget does not display the actual values, you may want to add those separately, e.g., using label widgets.</p></div>

<p>A <b>spinbox</b> widget allows users to choose numbers (or, in fact, items from an arbitrary list).  It does
this by combining an entry-like widget showing the current value with a pair of small up/down arrows, which
can be used to step through the range of possible choices.</p>

<p class=picture>

Spinbox widgets.</p>


<div class=python><p>Spinbox widgets are created using the <code><b>ttk.Spinbox</b></code> class:</p>
	<pre>spinval = StringVar()<br>s = ttk.Spinbox(<em>parent</em>, from_=1.0, to=100.0, textvariable=spinval)</pre></div>


<p>Like scale widgets, spinboxes let user choose a number between a certain range
(specified using the <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> configuration options), 
though through a very different user interface.  You can also specify an <code>increment</code>, which controls how much the value changes every time you click
the up or down button. </p>

<p>Like a listbox or combobox, spinboxes can also be used to let users choose an item from an arbitrary list of strings;
these can be specified using the <code>values</code> configuration option. This works in the same way it does for comboboxes;
specifying a list of values will override to <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> settings.</p>

<p>In their default state, spinboxes allow users to select values either via the up and down buttons, or by typing them directly into the
  entry area that displays the current value. If you'd like to disable the latter feature, so that only the up and down buttons are available,
  you can set the <code>readonly</code> state flag. 
  
<div class=python><pre>s.state(['readonly'])</pre></div>

<p>Like other themed widgets, you can also disable spinboxes, via the <code>disabled</code> state flag, or check the state via the <code>instate</code> method.
  Spinboxes also support validation in the same manner as entry widgets, using the <code>validate</code> and <code>validatecommand</code>
  configuration options.</p>

<div class=tip><p>You might be puzzled about when to choose a scale, listbox, combobox, entry, or a spinbox. Often, several of 
these can be used for the same types of data.  The answer really depends on what you want users to
select, platform user interface conventions, and the role the value plays in your user interface.
</p><p>
For example, both a combobox and a spinbox take up fairly small amounts of space compared with a listbox.
They might make sense for a more peripheral setting. A more primary and prominent choice in a user interface may warrant the extra space a listbox
occupies.  Spinboxes don't make much sense when items don't have a natural and obvious ordering to them.  
Be careful about putting too many items in both comboboxes and spinboxes. 
This can make it more time consuming to select an item.</p></div>

<p>There is a boolean <code>wrap</code> option that determines whether 
the value should wrap around when it goes beyond the starting or ending values.  You can also specify a <code>width</code>
for the entry holding the current value of the spinbox.</p>

<p>Again there are choices as to how to set or get the current value in the spinbox.  Normally, you would specify a linked 
variable with the <code>textvariable</code> configuration option. As usual, any changes to the variable are reflected in the spinbox,
while any changes in the spinbox are reflected in the linked variable.  As well, the <code>set <em>value</em></code> and <code>get</code>
methods allow you to set or get the value directly.</p>

<p>Spinboxes generate virtual events when users press up (<code>&lt;&lt;Increment&gt;&gt;</code>) or down (<code>&lt;&lt;Decrement&gt;&gt;</code>).
  A <code>command</code> configuration option allows you to provide a callback that is invoked on any changes.</p>
