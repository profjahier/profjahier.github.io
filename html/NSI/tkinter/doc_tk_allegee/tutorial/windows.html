<h1>Windows and Dialogs</h1>


<p>Everything we've done up until now has been in a single window.  In this chapter, we'll cover how to use multiple windows,
changing various attributes of windows, and use some of the standard dialog boxes that are available in Tk.</p>


 <a name="createdestroy"></a><h2>Creating and Destroying Windows</h2>

<p>We've seen that all Tk programs start out with a root toplevel window, and then widgets are created as children of 
that root window.  Creating new toplevel windows works almost exactly the same as creating new widgets.</p>

<div class=python>
<p>Toplevel windows are created using the <code><b>Toplevel</b></code> class:</p>
<pre>t = Toplevel(<em>parent</em>)</pre>
</div>

<p>Note: Toplevels are part of the classic Tk widgets, not the themed widgets.</p>

<p>Unlike regular widgets, we don't have to <code>grid</code> a toplevel for it to appear onscreen.  
  Once we've created a new toplevel, we can create other widgets as children of that toplevel, and <code>grid</code> them inside the toplevel.  
The new toplevel behaves exactly like the automatically created root window.</p>

<div class=python><p>To destroy a window, use its <code><b>destroy</b></code> method:</p><pre><em>window</em>.destroy()</pre></div>

<p>Note that you can use <code>destroy</code> on any widget, not just a toplevel window.  When you destroy a window, all windows (widgets) that
are children of that window are also destroyed.  Be careful! If you destroy the root window 
(that all other widgets are descended from), that will terminate your application.</p>

<div class=tip><p>In a typical document-oriented application, we want to be able to close any windows while leaving the others open.
  In that case, we may want to create a new toplevel for every window, and not put anything directly inside the root window at all.
  While we can't just destroy the root window, we can remove it entirely from the screen using its <code>withdraw</code> method, which
  we'll see shortly.
</p></div>


 <a name="wm"></a><h2>Window Behavior and Styles</h2>

<p>There are lots of things about how windows behave and how they look that can be changed.</p>

<h4>Window Title</h4>
<p>To examine or change the title of the window:</p>

<div class=python><pre>oldtitle = <em>window</em>.title()<br><em>window</em>.title('New title')</pre></div>

<h4>Size and Location</h4>

<p>In Tk, a window's position and size on the screen are known as its <em>geometry</em>.  A full geometry specification
looks like this: <code><em>width</em><b>x</b><em>height</em><b>&plusmn;</b><em>x</em><b>&plusmn;</b><em>y</em></code>.</p>

<p>Width and height (usually in pixels) are pretty self-explanatory.  The <code><em>x</em></code> (horizontal position) is specified with
a leading plus or minus, so <code>+25</code> means the left edge of the window should be 25 pixels from the left edge 
of the screen, while <code>-50</code> means the right edge of the window should be 50 pixels from the right edge of
the screen.  Similarly, a <code><em>y</em></code> (vertical) position of <code>+10</code> means the top edge of the window should be ten pixels
below the top of the screen, while <code>-100</code> means the bottom edge of the window should be 100 pixels above the bottom of
the screen.</p>

<div class=tip><p>Geometry specifies the actual coordinates on the screen. It doesn't make allowances for
systems like macOS with a menubar along the top or a dock along the bottom.  So specifying a
position of <code>+0+0</code> would actually place the top part of the window under the system menu bar.  It's a good idea
to leave a healthy margin (at least 30 pixels) from the screen's edge. 
</p><p>
Screen positions can be different than you might expect when you have multiple monitors on your system. We'll cover that shortly.
</p></div>

<p>Here is an example of changing the size and position. It places the window towards the top righthand corner
of the screen:</p>

<div class=python><pre><em>window</em>.geometry('300x200-5+40')</pre></div>

<p>You can retrieve the current geometry the same way; just don't provide a new geometry value.
  However, if you try it immediately after changing the geometry, you'll find it doesn't match.
  Remember that all drawing effectively occurs in the background, in response to idle times via the event loop. 
  Until that drawing occurs, the internal geometry of the window won't be updated. If you do want to force things to
  update immediately, you can.</p>

<div class=python><pre><em>window</em>.update_idletasks()
print(<em>window</em>.geometry())</pre></div>

<div class=tip><p>We've seen that the window defaults to the size requested by the widgets that are gridded into it.
  If we're creating and adding new widgets interactively in the interpreter, or if our program adds new widgets
  in response to other events, the window size adjusts. This behavior continues until either we explicitly provide
  the window's geometry as above <em>or</em> a user resizes the window. At that point, even if we add more widgets,
  the window won't change size. You'll want to be sure you're using all of <code>grid</code>'s features
  (e.g., <code>sticky</code>, <code>weight</code>) to make everything fit nicely.</p></div>


<h4>Resizing Behavior</h4>

<p>By default, toplevel windows, including the root window, can be resized by users.
However, sometimes you may want to prevent users from resizing the window.
You can do this via the <code>resizable</code> method. It's first parameter controls whether users can change the
width, and the second if they can change the height. So to disable all resizing:</p>

<div class=python><pre><em>window</em>.resizable(FALSE,FALSE)</pre></div>
<p>If a window is resizable, you can specify a minimum and/or maximum size that you'd like the window's size 
constrained to (again, parameters are width and height):</p>

<div class=python><pre><em>window</em>.minsize(200,100)
<em>window</em>.maxsize(500,500)</pre></div>

<p>You saw earlier how to obtain the current size of the window via its geometry. Wondering how large it would be if you
  didn't specify its geometry, or a user didn't resize it? You can retrieve the window's <em>requested size</em>, i.e., how much
  space it requests from the geometry manager. Like with drawing, geometry calculations are only done at idle time in the event
  loop, so you won't get a useful response until the widget has appeared onscreen.</p>
  
<div class=python><pre><em>window</em>.winfo_reqwidth()   <em># or winfo_reqheight</em></pre></div>

<div class=fyi><p>You can use the <code>reqwidth</code> and <code>reqheight</code> methods on any widget, not just toplevel windows.
  There are other <code>winfo</code> methods you can call on any widget, such as <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>,
  to get the actual (not requested) width and height. For more, see the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/winfo.htm"><code>winfo</code></a> command reference.
  </p></div>

<h4>Intercepting the Close Button</h4>

<p>Most windows have a close button in their title bar. By default, Tk will destroy the window if users click on that button.
  You can, however, provide a callback that will be run instead. A common use is to prompt the user to save an open file if 
  modifications have been made.</p>
  
<div class=python><pre><em>window</em>.protocol("WM_DELETE_WINDOW", <em>callback</em>)</pre></div>

<div class=fyi><p>The somewhat obscurely-named <code>WM_DELETE_PROTOCOL</code> originated with X11 window manager protocols.</p></div>

 
<h4>Transparency</h4>

<p>Windows can be made partially transparent by specifying an alpha channel, ranging from <code>0.0</code> (fully transparent) to <code>1.0</code> (fully opqaque).</p>

<div class=python><pre><em>window</em>.attributes("-alpha", 0.5)</pre>
  <div class=yuck><p>Tkinter's wrapper to the underlying <code>wm attributes</code> command doesn't do any interpretation of options, handle keyword arguments, etc.</p></div></div>

<p>On macOS, you can additionally specify a <code>-transparent</code> attribute (using the same mechanism as with <code>-alpha</code>), 
  which allows you to make the background of the window transparent, and remove the window's
  show. You should also set the <code>background</code> configuration option for the window and any frames to the color <code>ssytemTransparent</code>.</p>


<h4>Full Screen</h4>

<p>You can make a window expand to take up the full screen:</p>

<div class=python><pre><em>window</em>.attributes("-fullscreen", 1)</pre></div>

<h3>Iconifying and Withdrawing</h3>

<p>On most systems, you can temporarily remove the window from the screen by iconifying it.  In Tk, whether
or not a window is iconified is referred to as the window's <em>state</em>.  The possible states for a 
window include <code>normal</code> and <code>iconic</code> (for an iconified window), and several
others: <code>withdrawn</code>, <code>icon</code> or <code>zoomed</code>.</p>

<p>You can query or set the current window state directly. There are also methods <code>iconify</code>,
<code>deiconify</code>, and <code>withdraw</code>, which are shortcuts for setting the <code>iconic</code>, <code>normal</code>,
and <code>withdrawn</code> states, respectively.</p>

<div class=python><pre>thestate = <em>window</em>.state()
<em>window</em>.state('normal')
<em>window</em>.iconify()
<em>window</em>.deiconify()
<em>window</em>.withdraw()</pre></div>

<div class=tip><p>For document-centric applications, where you want to allow closing any window without the application exiting
  (as would happen if you destroy the root window), use <code>withdraw</code> on the root window to remove it from
  the screen, use new toplevel windows for your user interface.</p></div>
  
	
<h3>Stacking Order</h3>

<p>Stacking order refers to the order that windows are "placed" on the screen, from bottom to top.  When
the positions of two windows overlap each other, the one closer to the top of the stacking order will
obscure or overlap the one lower in the stacking order.</p>

<p>You can ensure that a window is always at the top of the stacking order (or at least above all others where this attribute isn't set):</p>

<div class=python><pre><em>window</em>.attributes("-topmost", 1)</pre></div>
<p>You can find the current stacking order, listed from lowest to highest:</p>

<div class=python><pre>root.tk.eval('wm stackorder '+str(<em>window</em>))</pre><div class=yuck><p>This method isn't exposed cleanly in Tkinter. It returns the internal names of each window, not the window object.</p></div></div>

<p>You can also just check if one window is above or below another:</p>

<div class=python><pre>if (root.tk.eval('wm stackorder '+str(<em>window</em>)+' isabove '+str(<em>otherwindow</em>))=='1') ...
if (root.tk.eval('wm stackorder '+str(<em>window</em>)+' isbelow '+str(<em>otherwindow</em>))=='1') ...</pre></div>

<p>You can also raise or lower windows, either to the very top (bottom) of the stacking order, or just
above (below) a designated window:</p>

<div class=python><pre><em>window</em>.lift()
<em>window</em>.lift(<em>otherwin</em>)
<em>window</em>.lower()
<em>window</em>.lower(<em>otherwin</em>)</pre>
<div class=fyi><p>Tkinter uses the name <code>lift</code> since <code>raise</code> is a reserved keyword in Python.</p></div></div>

<p>Why do you need to pass a window to get the stacking order?  
Stacking order applies not only for toplevel windows, but for any <em>sibling</em>
widgets (those with the same parent).  If you have several widgets gridded together but
overlapping, you can raise and lower them relative to each other:</p>	

<div class=python><pre>from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk
root = Tk()
little = ttk.Label(root, text="Little")
bigger = ttk.Label(root, text='Much bigger label')
little.grid(column=0,row=0)
bigger.grid(column=0,row=0)
root.after(2000, lambda: little.lift())
root.mainloop()</pre></div>

<div class=fyi><p>This uses timer events, which we covered in the event loop chapter.
  The <code>after</code> command schedules a script to run at a certain number of
milliseconds in the future, but leaves the event loop to continue.</p></div>


<h3>Screen Information</h3>

<p></p>


<p>We've previously used the <code>winfo</code> command to find out information about specific widgets. It can also provide information about the
  entire display or <em>screen</em>. As usual, see the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/winfo.htm"><code>winfo</code></a> command reference 
  for full details.</p>
  
  
<p>For example, you can determine the screen's color depth (how many bits per pixel) and color model (usually <code>truecolor</code> on modern displays), 
  it's pixel density, and resolution.</p>
  
<div class=python><pre>print("color depth=" + str(root.winfo_screendepth())+ " (" + root.winfo_screenvisual() + ")")
print("pixels per inch=" + str(root.winfo_pixels('1i')))
print("width=", str(root.winfo_screenwidth()) + " height=", str(root.winfo_screenheight()))
</pre></div>
  
<h4>Multiple Monitors</h4>

<p>While normally you shouldn't have to pay attention to it, if you do have multiple monitors on your system and want to customize things a
  bit, there are some tools in Tk to help.</p>
  
<p>First, there are two ways that multiple monitors can be represented. The first is with logically separate displays. This is often the
  case on X11 systems, though it can be changed, e.g., using the <code>xrandr</code> system utility. A downside of this model is that once a
  window is created on a screen, it can't be moved to a different one. You can determine the screen that a Tk
  window is running on, which looks something like <code>:0.0</code> (an X11-formatted display name).</p>  

<div class=python><pre>root.winfo_screen()</pre></div>
  
<p>When first creating a <code>toplevel</code> you can specify the screen it should be created on using the <code>screen</code> configuration option.</p>

<div class=fyi><p>Different monitors may have different resolutions, color depths, etc. You'll notice that all the screen information calls we just covered
  are methods invoked on a specific widget. They will return information about whatever screen that window is located on.</p></div>
  
<p>Alternatively, multiple monitors can also be represented as one big virtual display, which is the case on macOS and Windows.  
  When you ask for information about the screen, Tk will return information on the <em>primary monitor</em>.  For example, if you have two Full HD
  monitors side-by-side, the screen resolution will be reported as 1920 x 1080, not 3840 x 1080. This is probably a good thing; it means that if
  we're positioning or sizing windows, we don't need to worry about multiple monitors, and everything will just show up correctly on the primary
  monitor.</p>
  
<p>What if a user moves a window from the primary monitor to a different one? If you ask for its position, it will be relative to the primary monitor. 
  So in our side-by-side FHD monitor setup, if you call the <code>winfo_x</code> method on a window positioned near the left edge of a monitor, it
  might return <code>100</code> (if it's on the primary monitor), <code>-1820</code> (if it's on a monitor to the left of the primary monitor), 
  or <code>2020</code> (if it's on a monitor to the right of the primary monitor). You can still use the <code>geometry</code> method we saw
  a bit earlier to position the window on a different monitor, even though the geometry specification may look a bit odd,
  e.g., <code>+-1820+100</code>.</p>
  
<p>You can find out approximately how large the entire display is, spanning multiple monitors. To do so, check a toplevel widget's maximum size,
  i.e., how large the user can resize it (you can't do this after you've already changed it, of course). This may be a bit smaller than the full
  size of the display. For example, on macOS, it will be reduced by the size of the menubar at the top of the screen.</p>

<div class=python><pre>root.wm_maxsize()</pre></div>
  
  
  
 <a name="dialogs"></a><h2>Dialog Windows</h2>

<p>Dialog boxes are a type of window used in applications to get some information from users, 
inform them that some event has occurred, confirm an action, and more.  The appearance and usage
of dialog boxes are usually quite specifically detailed in a platform's style guide.  Tk comes
with several dialog boxes built-in for common tasks. These help you conform to platform-specific style guidelines.</p>


<h4>Selecting Files and Directories</h4>


<p>Tk provides several dialogs to let users select files or directories.  On Windows and macOS,
these invoke the underlying operating system dialogs directly.  The "open" variant on the
dialog is used when you want users to select an existing file (like in a <code>"File | Open..."</code>
menu command), while the "save" variant is used to choose a file to save into (usually used
by the <code>"File | Save As..."</code> menu command).</p>

<div class=python><pre>from tkinter import filedialog
filename = filedialog.askopenfilename()
filename = filedialog.asksaveasfilename()
dirname = filedialog.askdirectory()</pre></div>

<p>All of these commands produce <em>modal</em> dialogs. This means that the commands will not complete
   until a user submits the dialog.  These commands
return the full pathname of the file or directory a user has chosen, or an empty
string if a user cancels out of the dialog.</p>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/getopenfile_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Open file dialogs.</p>

<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/getsavefile_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Save file dialogs.</p>

<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/choosedir_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Choose directory dialogs.</p>


<p>Various options can be passed to these dialogs, allowing you to set the
allowable file types, initial directory, default filename, and many more.  These are detailed
in the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/getOpenFile.htm">getOpenFile</a> (includes <code>getSaveFile</code>) and 
<a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/chooseDirectory.htm">chooseDirectory</a> reference manual pages.</p>



<h4>Selecting Colors</h4>

<p>Another modal dialog lets users select a color.  It will return a color value, e.g. <code>#ff62b8</code>.
The dialog takes an optional <code>initialcolor</code> option to specify an existing color, i.e., that users
might want to replace. More information is available in the 
<a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/chooseDirectory.htm">chooseColor</a> reference manual pages.</p>



<div class=python><pre>from tkinter import colorchooser
colorchooser.askcolor(initialcolor='#ff0000')</pre></div>

<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/choosecolor_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Choose color dialogs.</p>


<h4>Selecting Fonts</h4>


<p>Tk 8.6 added support for another system dialog: a font chooser. While the file dialogs and color chooser were modal dialogs,
 that block until the dialog is dismissed and then return a result, the font chooser doesn't work like that.</p>

<div class=tip><p>As the font chooser isn't available in Tk 8.5, if your code needs to support older Tk versions, you'll need to
  take that into account.</p></div>
 
<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/fontchooser_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Font chooser dialogs.</p>
 
 
 <p>While the system font dialog is modal on some platforms, e.g., Windows, that's not the case everywhere. On macOS, the system font chooser works more
 like a floating tool palette in a drawing program, remaining available to change the font for whatever text is selected in your main application window. 
 The Tk font dialog API has to accommodate both models. To do so, it uses callbacks (and virtual events) to notify your application of font changes.
 Additional details can be found in the  <a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/fontchooser.htm">fontchooser</a> reference manual pages.</p>



<p>To use the font dialog, first provide it with an initial font and a callback which will be invoked when a font is chosen. For illustration, we'll
  have the callback change the font on a label.</p>

<div class=python><pre>l = ttk.Label(root, text="Hello World", font="helvetica 24")
l.grid(padx=10, pady=10)

def font_changed(font):
    l['font'] = font

root.tk.call('tk', 'fontchooser', 'configure', '-font', 'helvetica 24', '-command', root.register(font_changed))
root.tk.call('tk', 'fontchooser', 'show')
</pre>
<p>Tkinter has not yet added a convenient way to use this new dialog, so this example code uses the Tcl API directly. You can see the latest
  work towards a proper Python API and download code at [<a href='../../external.html?link=http://bugs.python.org/issue28694'>Issue#28694</a>].</p>
</div>


<div class=tip><p>You can query or change the font that is (or will be) displayed in the dialog at any time.</p></div>

<p>Next, put the dialog onscreen via the <code>show</code> method. On platforms where the font dialog is modal, your program will block at this point until the dialog is
  dismissed. On other platforms, <code>show</code> returns immediately; the dialog remains onscreen while your program continues. At this point, a font has not been chosen.  
  There's also a <code>hide</code> method to remove it from the screen (not terribly useful when the font dialog is modal).</p>

<div class=python><pre>root.tk.call('tk', 'fontchooser', 'show')
root.tk.call('tk', 'fontchooser', 'hide')
</pre></div>

<p>If the font dialog was modal, and the user chose a font, the dialog would have invoked your callback, passing it a font specification. If they cancelled out of the 
  dialog, there'd be no callback. When the dialog isn't modal, and the user chooses a font, it will invoke your callback. A &lt;&lt;TkFontchooserFontChanged&gt;&gt;
  virtual event is also generated; you can retrieve the current font via the dialog's <code>font</code> configuration option. If the font dialog is closed,
  a &lt;&lt;TkFontchooserVisibility&gt;&gt; virtual event is generated. You can also find out if the font dialog is currently visible onscreen via the
  <code>visible</code> configuration option (though changing it is an error; use the <code>show</code> and <code>hide</code> methods instead).</p>
  
<div class=tip><p>Because of the significant differences between them, providing a good user experience on all platforms takes a bit of work. On platforms where the 
  font dialog is modal,it's likely to be invoked from a button or menu item that says, e.g., <code>Font...</code>. On other platforms, the button or menu
  item should toggle between <code>Show Fonts</code> and <code>Hide Fonts</code>.
  </p><p>
  If you have several text widgets in your application that can be given
  different fonts, when one of them gains focus, it should update the font chooser with its current font. This also means that a callback from the font
  dialog may apply to a different text widget than the one you initially called <code>show</code> from! Finally, be aware that the font chooser itself may 
  gain the keyboard focus on some platforms. </p></div>

<div class=yuck><p>
  As of Tk 8.6.10, there are a few bugs in the font chooser on various platforms. Here's a quick rundown including workarounds:
  <ul>
    <li> on macOS, if you don't provide a font via the <code>font</code> configuration option, your callbacks won't be invoked &#8658; always provide an initial font</li>
    <li> on X11, if you don't provide values for all configuration options, those you don't include will be reset to their default values &#8658; whenever you change any option, change all of them, even if it's just to their current value</li>
    <li> on X11, the font dialog includes an <code>Apply</code> button when you provide a callback, but omits it when you don't (and just watch for virtual events); however,
      other bugs mean those virtual events are never generated &#8658; always provide a command callback
    <li> on Windows, you can also leave off the <code>Apply</code> button by not providing a callback; while virtual events are generated on font changes, the <code>font</code>
      configuration option is never updated &#8658; always provide a command callback, and hold onto the font yourself, rather than trying to ask the font dialog
      for it later</li>
    <li> on Windows, a font change virtual event is not generated if you change the <code>font</code> configuration option in your code, though it is on macOS and X11 &#8658; take
      any necessary actions when you change the font in your code rather than in a virtual event handler
  </ul>
  <p>Because of the differences between platforms and the various bugs, testing is far more important when using the font chooser than the other system dialogs.
</p></div>



<h4>Alert and Confirmation Dialogs</h4>

<p>Many applications use various simple modal alerts or dialogs to notify users of an event, ask them
to confirm an action, or make another similar choice via clicking on a button.  Tk provides
a versatile "message box" that encapsulates all these different types of dialogs.</p>

<div class=python><pre>from tkinter import messagebox
messagebox.showinfo(message='Have a good day')</pre></div>

<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/alert_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Simple message boxes.</p>



<div class=python><pre>messagebox.askyesno(
	   message='Are you sure you want to install SuperVirus?'
	   icon='question' title='Install')</pre></div>

<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/messagebox_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Example message boxes.</p>


<p>Like the previous dialogs that we've seen, these are modal and return the result of a user's
action to the caller.  The exact return value will depend on the <code>type</code> option passed to

<div class=python>
<p>
  
  Rather than using a <code>type</code> option, Tkinter uses a different method name for each type of dialog.
  The return values vary with the method:</p>

<dl class="row ml-sm-1">
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>showinfo</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">&#8658; <code>"ok"</code></dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>showwarning</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">&#8658; <code>"ok"</code></dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>showerror</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">&#8658; <code>"ok"</code></dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>askokcancel</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">&#8658; <code>True</code> (on ok) or <code>False</code> (on cancel)</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>askyesno</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">&#8658; <code>True</code> (on yes) or <code>False</code> (on no)</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>askretrycancel</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">&#8658; <code>True</code> (on retry) or <code>False</code> (on cancel)</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>askquestion</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">&#8658; <code>"yes"</code> or <code>"no"</code></dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>askyesnocancel</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">&#8658; <code>True</code> (on yes), <code>False</code> (on no), or <code>None</code> (on cancel)</dd>
</dl>
  
  <div class=yuck><p>Admittedly, the Tkinter <code>messagebox</code> API isn't the most consistent. It mixes return types (strings or booleans),
    there is some duplication (<code>askyesno</code> and <code>askquestion</code>), and one underlying dialog 
    type (<code>abortretryignore</code>) is omitted.</p></div>
</div>


<p>The full list of possible options is shown here:</p>

<dl class="row ml-sm-1">
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>type</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">As described above.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>message</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">The main message displayed inside the alert.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>detail</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">A secondary message (if needed).</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>title</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">Title for the dialog window.  Not used on macOS.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>icon</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">Icon, one of <code>info</code> (default), <code>error</code>, <code>question</code> or <code>warning</code>.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>default</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">Default button, e.g. <code>ok</code> or <code>cancel</code> for a <code>okcancel</code> dialog.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>parent</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">Window of your application this dialog is being posted for.</dd>

<h3>Rolling Your Own</h3>

<p>If you need to create your own modal dialogs, there are a few things you'll need to take care of. We've covered most
  of them earlier in the chapter, e.g. setting up window styles, positioning the window, etc.</p>

<p>First, you need to ensure that users can only interact with your dialog. You can use <code>grab_set</code> to do this.</p>

<p>If you want your dialog function to block your application (i.e., the call to create the dialog shouldn't return until the
  dialog is dismissed), this is also possible. There's no reason you'd <em>need</em> to do this, as you can respond to
  callbacks, event bindings, etc. while running the normal event loop, destroy the dialog and move on.</p> 

<p>This somewhat cryptic example includes the main steps needed to create a modal dialog.</p>

<div class=python><pre>ttk.Entry(root).grid()   <em># something to interact with</em>
def dismiss ():
    dlg.grab_release()
    dlg.destroy()

dlg = Toplevel(root)
ttk.Button(dlg, text="Done", command=dismiss).grid()
dlg.protocol("WM_DELETE_WINDOW", dismiss) <em># intercept close button</em>
dlg.transient(root)   <em># dialog window is related to main</em>
dlg.wait_visibility() <em># can't grab until window appears, so we wait</em>
dlg.grab_set()        <em># ensure all input goes to our window</em>
dlg.wait_window()     <em># block until window is destroyed</em></pre></div>

<div class=tip><p>Application code blocking like this is an example of running a nested event loop that we generally recommend against,
  though it may be more convenient in certain circumstances.</p></div>  

<div class=python><p>Tkinter's standard library includes a <code>simpledialog</code>  module that helps with building your own
  dialogs. Because it uses the classic Tk widgets rather than the newer themed widgets, we don't recommend using it
  directly. However, it does illustrate how to use some of the techniques for making dialogs behave that we just covered.</p>
