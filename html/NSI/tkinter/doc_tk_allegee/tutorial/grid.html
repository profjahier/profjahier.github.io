<h1>The Grid Geometry Manager</h1>


<p>We'll take a bit of a break from talking about different widgets (what to put onscreen) and
focus instead on geometry management (where to put those widgets).  We introduced the general idea of 
geometry management in the "Tk Concepts" chapter. Here, we focus on one specific geometry manager: <code>grid</code>.</p>

<p>As we've seen, <code>grid</code> lets you layout widgets in columns and rows.  If you're familiar with using
HTML tables to do layout, you'll feel right at home here.  This chapter illustrates the various ways
you can tweak grid to give you all the control you need for your user interface.</p>

<p>Grid is one of several geometry managers available in Tk, but its mix of power, flexibility, and ease of use make it the best choice
for general use.   Its constraint model is a natural fit with today's layouts that rely on the alignment of widgets.
There are other geometry managers in Tk: <code>pack</code> is also quite powerful, but harder to
use and understand, while <code>place</code> gives you complete control of positioning each element. 
Even widgets like paned windows, notebooks, canvas, and text that we'll explore later can act as geometry managers.</p>


<div class=upgrade><p>It's worth noting that <code>grid</code> was first introduced to Tk in 1996, several years after Tk became popular, and it took a while to catch on.
Before that, developers had always used <code>pack</code> to do constraint-based geometry management.  When <code>grid</code> came
out, many developers kept using <code>pack</code>, and you'll still find it used in many Tk programs and documentation.
While there's nothing technically wrong with <code>pack</code>, the algorithm's behavior is often hard to understand.
More importantly, because the order that widgets are packed is significant in determining layout, modifying
existing layouts can be more difficult.  Aligning widgets in different parts of the user interface is also much trickier.
</p><p>
Grid has all the power of pack, produces nicer layouts (that align widgets both horizontally and vertically), and is easier to learn and use.
Because of that, we think grid is the right choice for most developers most of the time.  Start
your new programs using grid, and switch old ones to grid as you're making changes to an existing user interface.</p></div>

<p>The <a href="https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/grid.htm">reference documentation for grid</a> provides an
exhaustive description of grid, its behaviors and all options.</p>



 <a name="colsrows"></a><h2>Columns and Rows</h2>

<p>In grid, widgets are assigned a <code>column</code> number and a <code>row</code> number. These indicate each widget's position
relative to other widgets. All widgets in the same column will be above or below each other.
Those in the same row will be to the left or right of each other.</p>

<p>Column and row numbers must be positive integers (i.e., 0, 1, 2, ...). You don't have to start at 0 and can
leave gaps in column and row numbers (e.g., column 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 20, 21). This is useful
if you plan to add more widgets in the middle of the user interface later.</p>

<p>The width of each column will vary depending on the width of the widgets contained within the column.
  Ditto for the height of each row.  This means when sketching out your user interface and 
dividing it into rows and columns, you don't need to worry about each column or row being
equal width.</p>


 <a name="span"></a><h2>Spanning Multiple Cells</h2>

<p>Widgets can take up more than a single cell in the grid; to do this, we'll use the <code>columnspan</code>
and <code>rowspan</code> options when gridding the widget.  These are analogous to the "colspan" and "rowspan"
attribute of HTML tables. </p>

<p>Here is an example of creating a user interface with multiple widgets, some that take up
more than a single cell.</p>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/gridexample1.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Gridding multiple widgets.</p>

<div class=python><pre>from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk

root = Tk()

content = ttk.Frame(root)
frame = ttk.Frame(content, borderwidth=5, relief="ridge", width=200, height=100)
namelbl = ttk.Label(content, text="Name")
name = ttk.Entry(content)

onevar = BooleanVar(value=True)
twovar = BooleanVar(value=False)
threevar = BooleanVar(value=True)

one = ttk.Checkbutton(content, text="One", variable=onevar, onvalue=True)
two = ttk.Checkbutton(content, text="Two", variable=twovar, onvalue=True)
three = ttk.Checkbutton(content, text="Three", variable=threevar, onvalue=True)
ok = ttk.Button(content, text="Okay")
cancel = ttk.Button(content, text="Cancel")

content.grid(column=0, row=0)
frame.grid(column=0, row=0, columnspan=3, rowspan=2)
namelbl.grid(column=3, row=0, columnspan=2)
name.grid(column=3, row=1, columnspan=2)
one.grid(column=0, row=3)
two.grid(column=1, row=3)
three.grid(column=2, row=3)
ok.grid(column=3, row=3)
cancel.grid(column=4, row=3)

root.mainloop()
</pre></div>

 <a name="incell"></a><h2>Layout within the Cell</h2>


<p>Because the width of a column (and height of a row) depends on all the widgets that have been
added to it, the odds are that at least some widgets will have a smaller width or height than
has been allocated for the cell its been placed in.  So the question becomes, where exactly 
should it be put within the cell?</p>

<p>By default, if a cell is larger than the widget contained in it, the widget will be centered
within it, both horizontally and vertically. The master's background will display
in the empty space around it. In the figure below, the widget in the top right is smaller than the
cell allocated to it. The (white) background of the master fills the rest of the cell.</p>

<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/gridlayout.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Layout within the cell and the 'sticky' option.</p>

<p>The <code>sticky</code> option can change this default behavior.
Its value is a string of 0 or more of the compass directions <code>nsew</code>, 
specifying which edges of the cell the widget should be "stuck" to.  For example, a
value of <code>n</code> (north) will jam the widget up against the top side, with any extra vertical
space on the bottom; the widget will still be centered horizontally.  A value of <code>nw</code> (north-west)
means the widget will be stuck to the top left corner, with extra space on the bottom and right.</p>

<div class=tip><p>In Tkinter, you can also specify this as a list containing any of <code>N</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>E</code>, and <code>W</code>.
It's a stylistic choice, and we'll tend to use the list format in this book. 
</p></div>

<p>Specifying two opposite edges, such as <code>we</code> (west, east) means that the widget will be stretched.
In this case, it will be stuck to both the left and right edge of the cell.  So the widget will then be wider
than its "ideal" size.</p>	

<p>If you want the widget to expand to fill up the entire cell, grid it with a sticky value of <code>nsew</code>
(north, south, east, west), meaning it will stick to every side. This is shown in the bottom left widget in the above figure.</p>

<div class=tip><p>
Most widgets have options that can control how they are displayed if
they are larger than needed.  For example, a label widget has an <code>anchor</code> option that
controls where the label's text will be positioned within the widget's boundaries. The bottom left label 
in the figure above uses the default anchor (<code>w</code>, i.e., left side, vertically centered). 
</p><p>
If you're having trouble getting things to line up the way you want them to,
first make sure you know large the widget is. As we discussed with the
<code>label</code> widget in the previous chapter, changing the widget's background or border can help.
the </p></div>


 <a name="resize"></a><h2>Handling Resize</h2>

<p>If you've tried to resize the example, you'll notice that nothing moves at all, as shown below.</p>

<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/gridnoresize.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Resizing the window.</p>

<p>
Even if you took a peek below and added the extra <code>sticky</code> options to our example, you'd still see the
same thing. It looks like <code>sticky</code> may tell Tk <em>how</em> to react if the cell's row or column does resize, 
but doesn't actually say that the row or columns <em>should</em> resize if extra room becomes available.  
Let's fix that. </p>

<p>Every column and row in the grid has a <code>weight</code> option associated with it. This tells <code>grid</code> how much 
the column or row should grow if there is extra room in the master to fill.  By default, the weight of each column or
row is 0, meaning it won't expand to fill any extra space.</p>

<p>For the user interface to resize then, we'll need to specify a positive weight to the columns that
we'd like to expand.  This is done using the <code>columnconfigure</code> and <code>rowconfigure</code> methods of <code>grid</code>.
This weight is relative. If two columns have the same weight, they'll expand at the same rate.
In our example, we'll give the three leftmost columns (holding the checkbuttons) a weight of 3, and the two rightmost columns
a weight of 1. For every one pixel the right columns grow, the left columns will grow by three pixels. So as the window grows
larger, most of the extra space will go to the left side. </p>

<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/gridresize.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Resizing the window after adding weights.</p>

<p>Both <code>columnconfigure</code> and <code>rowconfigure</code> also take a <code>minsize</code> grid option,
which specifies a minimum size which you really don't want the column or row to shrink beyond.</p>


 <a name="padding"></a><h2>Padding</h2>


<p>Normally, each column or row will be directly adjacent to the next, so that widgets will be
right next to each other.  This is sometimes what you want (think of a listbox and its scrollbar),
but often you want some space between widgets.  In Tk, this is called padding, and there are
several ways you can choose to add it.</p>

<p>We've already actually seen one way, and that is using a widget's own options to add the extra
space around it.  Not all widgets have this, but one that does is a frame; this is useful because
frames are most often used as the master to grid other widgets.  The frame's <code>padding</code>
option lets you specify a bit of extra padding inside the frame, whether the same amount for
each of the four sides or even different for each.</p>

<p>A second way is using the <code>padx</code> and <code>pady</code> grid options when adding the widget.  As you'd
expect, <code>padx</code> puts a bit of extra space to the left and right, while <code>pady</code>
adds extra space top and bottom.  A single value for the option puts the same padding on
both left and right (or top and bottom), while a two-value list lets you put different amounts
on left and right (or top and bottom).  Note that this extra padding is within the grid cell
containing the widget.</p>

<p>If you want to add padding around an entire row or column, the <code>columnconfigure</code> and <code>rowconfigure</code>
methods accept a <code>pad</code> option, which will do this for you.</p>

<p>Let's add the extra sticky, resizing, and padding behavior to our example (additions in bold).</p>

<div class=python><pre>from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk

root = Tk()

content = ttk.Frame(root, <b>padding=(3,3,12,12)</b>)
frame = ttk.Frame(content, borderwidth=5, relief="ridge", width=200, height=100)
namelbl = ttk.Label(content, text="Name")
name = ttk.Entry(content)

onevar = BooleanVar()
twovar = BooleanVar()
threevar = BooleanVar()

onevar.set(True)
twovar.set(False)
threevar.set(True)

one = ttk.Checkbutton(content, text="One", variable=onevar, onvalue=True)
two = ttk.Checkbutton(content, text="Two", variable=twovar, onvalue=True)
three = ttk.Checkbutton(content, text="Three", variable=threevar, onvalue=True)
ok = ttk.Button(content, text="Okay")
cancel = ttk.Button(content, text="Cancel")

content.grid(column=0, row=0, <b>sticky=(N, S, E, W)</b>)
frame.grid(column=0, row=0, columnspan=3, rowspan=2, <b>sticky=(N, S, E, W)</b>)
namelbl.grid(column=3, row=0, columnspan=2, <b>sticky=(N, W), padx=5</b>)
name.grid(column=3, row=1, columnspan=2, <b>sticky=(N,E,W),</b> <b>pady=5,</b> <b>padx=5</b>)
one.grid(column=0, row=3)
two.grid(column=1, row=3)
three.grid(column=2, row=3)
ok.grid(column=3, row=3)
cancel.grid(column=4, row=3)

<b>root.columnconfigure(0, weight=1)</b>
<b>root.rowconfigure(0, weight=1)</b>
<b>content.columnconfigure(0, weight=3)</b>
<b>content.columnconfigure(1, weight=3)</b>
<b>content.columnconfigure(2, weight=3)</b>
<b>content.columnconfigure(3, weight=1)</b>
<b>content.columnconfigure(4, weight=1)</b>
<b>content.rowconfigure(1, weight=1)</b>

root.mainloop()</pre></div>


<p>This looks more promising.  Play around with the example to get a feel for the resize behavior.</p>

 <a name="morefeatures"></a><h2>Additional Grid Features</h2>

<p>If you look at the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/grid.htm">reference documentation</a> for <code>grid</code>, you'll see
many other things you can do with grid.  Here are a few of the more useful ones.</p>



<h3>Querying and Changing Grid Options</h3>

<p>Like widgets themselves, it's easy to introspect the various grid options or change them.
Setting options when you first grid the widget is certainly convenient, but you can change
them anytime you'd like.</p>

<p>The <code>slaves</code> method will tell you all the widgets that have been gridded inside a master, or optionally
those within just a certain column or row.  The <code>info</code> method will return a list of all the grid
options for a widget and their values.  Finally, the <code>configure</code> method lets you change one or more
grid options on a widget. </p>

<p>These are illustrated in this interactive session:</p>

<div class=python><pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>content.grid_slaves()</b>
[&lt;tkinter.ttk.Button object .!frame.!button2&gt;, &lt;tkinter.ttk.Button object .!frame.!button&gt;,
&lt;tkinter.ttk.Checkbutton object .!frame.!checkbutton3&gt;, &lt;tkinter.ttk.Checkbutton object .!frame.!checkbutton2&gt;,
&lt;tkinter.ttk.Checkbutton object .!frame.!checkbutton&gt;, &lt;tkinter.ttk.Entry object .!frame.!entry&gt;, 
&lt;tkinter.ttk.Label object .!frame.!label&gt;, &lt;tkinter.ttk.Frame object .!frame.!frame&gt;]
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>for w in content.grid_slaves(): print(w)</b>
...

.!frame.!button

...

.!frame.!checkbutton2
.!frame.!checkbutton
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>for w in content.grid_slaves(column=0): print(w)</b>
...
.!frame.!checkbutton
.!frame.!frame
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>namelbl.grid_info()</b>
{'in': &lt;tkinter.ttk.Frame object .!frame&gt;, 'column': 3, 'row': 0, 'columnspan': 2, 'rowspan': 1, 
'ipadx': 0, 'ipady': 0, 'padx': 5, 'pady': 0, 'sticky': 'nw'}
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>namelbl.grid_configure(sticky=(E,W))</b>
&gt;&gt;&gt; <b>namelbl.grid_info()</b>
{'in': &lt;tkinter.ttk.Frame object .!frame&gt;, 'column': 3, 'row': 0, 'columnspan': 2, 'rowspan': 1, 
'ipadx': 0, 'ipady': 0, 'padx': 5, 'pady': 0, 'sticky': 'ew'}</pre></div>


<h3>Internal Padding</h3>

<p>You saw how the <code>padx</code> and <code>pady</code> grid options added extra space around the outside of a widget.
There's also a less used type of padding called "internal padding" controlled by the
grid options <code>ipadx</code> and <code>ipady</code>.</p>

<p>The difference can be subtle.  Let's say you have a frame that's 20x20, and specify normal (external)
padding of 5 pixels on each side.  The frame will request a 20x20 rectangle (its natural size) from
the geometry manager.  Normally, that's what it will be granted, so it'll get a 20x20 rectangle for
the frame, surrounded by a 5-pixel border.</p>

<p>With internal padding, the geometry manager will effectively add the extra padding to the widget when
figuring out its natural size, as if the widget has requested a 30x30 rectangle.  If the frame is
centered, or attached to a single side or corner (using <code>sticky</code>), we'll end up with a 20x20 frame
with extra space around it.  If, however, the frame is set to stretch (i.e., a <code>sticky</code> value of <code>we</code>,
<code>ns</code>, or <code>nwes</code>), it will fill the extra space, resulting in a 30x30 frame, with no border.</p>


<h3>Forget and Remove</h3>

<p>The <code>forget</code> method of grid removes slaves from the grid they're currently part of.  
It takes a list of one or more slave widgets as arguments. This does not destroy the widget altogether but takes it off the
screen as if it had not been gridded in the first place.  You can grid it again later, though any grid options
you'd originally assigned will have been lost. </p>

<p>The <code>remove</code> method of grid works the same, except that the grid options will be remembered if you <code>grid</code> it again later.</p>

	
 <a name="nestedlayout"></a><h2>Nested Layouts</h2>


<p>As your user interface gets more complicated, the grid that you're using to organize all your widgets can
get increasingly complicated.  This can make changing and maintaining your program
very difficult.</p>

<p>Luckily, you don't have to manage your entire user interface with a single grid.  If you have one area of
your user interface that is fairly independent of others, create a new frame to hold that area and grid
the widgets in area within that frame.  For example, if you were building a graphics editor with
multiple palettes, toolbars, etc., each one of those areas might be a candidate for putting in its
own frame.</p>

<p>In theory, these frames, each with its own grid, can be nested arbitrarily deep, though, in practice, this
usually doesn't go beyond a few levels.  This can be a big help in modularizing your program.  If, for 
example, you have a palette of drawing tools, you can create the whole thing in a separate function or class. It would
be responsible for creating all the component widgets, gridding them together, setting up event bindings, etc.
The details of how things work inside that palette can be contained in that one piece of code.
From the point of view of your main program, all it needs to know about is the single frame widget containing
your palette.  </p>

<p>Our examples have shown just a hint of this, where a content frame was gridded into the main window,
and then all the other widgets gridded into the content frame.</p>

<p>As your own programs grow larger, you'll likely run into situations where making a change in the layout of
one part of your interface requires code changes to the layout of another part. That may be a clue to reconsider
how you're using <code>grid</code> and if splitting out components into separate frames would help.</p>
