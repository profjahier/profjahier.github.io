<h1>A First (Real) Example</h1>


<p>With that out of the way, let's try a slightly more substantial example, which will give you an
initial feel for what the code behind a real Tk program looks like.</p>

 <a name="design"></a><h2>Design</h2>

<p>We'll create a simple GUI tool to convert a distance in feet to the equivalent
distance in meters.   If we were to sketch this out, it might look something like this:</p>

<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/calcsketch.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
A sketch of our feet to meters conversion program.</p>

<p>So it looks like we have a short text entry widget that will let us type in the number of
feet. A "Calculate" button will get the value out of that entry, perform the
calculation, and  put the result in a label below the entry.
We've also got three static labels ("feet," "is equivalent to," and "meters"),
which help our user figure out how to work the application.</p>

<p>The next thing we need to do is look at the layout. The widgets that we've included seem to be naturally divided into a grid with three columns and three rows. In terms of layout, things seem to naturally divide into three columns and three rows, as illustrated below:</p>

<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/calcgrid.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
The layout of our user interface, which follows a 3 x 3 grid.</p>


 <a name="code"></a><h2>Code</h2>

<div class=python>
<p>Now here is the Python code needed to create this entire application using Tkinter.</p>
<pre>from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk

def calculate(*args):
    try:
        value = float(feet.get())
        meters.set(int(0.3048 * value * 10000.0 + 0.5)/10000.0)
    except ValueError:
        pass

root = Tk()
root.title("Feet to Meters")

mainframe = ttk.Frame(root, padding="3 3 12 12")
mainframe.grid(column=0, row=0, sticky=(N, W, E, S))
root.columnconfigure(0, weight=1)
root.rowconfigure(0, weight=1)

feet = StringVar()
feet_entry = ttk.Entry(mainframe, width=7, textvariable=feet)
feet_entry.grid(column=2, row=1, sticky=(W, E))

meters = StringVar()
ttk.Label(mainframe, textvariable=meters).grid(column=2, row=2, sticky=(W, E))

ttk.Button(mainframe, text="Calculate", command=calculate).grid(column=3, row=3, sticky=W)

ttk.Label(mainframe, text="feet").grid(column=3, row=1, sticky=W)
ttk.Label(mainframe, text="is equivalent to").grid(column=1, row=2, sticky=E)
ttk.Label(mainframe, text="meters").grid(column=3, row=2, sticky=W)

for child in mainframe.winfo_children(): 
    child.grid_configure(padx=5, pady=5)

feet_entry.focus()
root.bind("&lt;Return&gt;", calculate)

root.mainloop()
</pre>
</div>

<div class=fyi><p>As we'll see in the next chapter, there's another, more object-oriented way to do exactly the same thing.
Are we surprised?</p></div>
</div>


<p>And the resulting user interface:</p>

<h3>A Note on Coding Style</h3>


<p>Each of the languages included in this tutorial has a variety of coding styles and conventions
available to choose from, which help determine conventions for variable and function naming,
procedural, functional or object-oriented styles, and so on. </p>

<p>Because the focus on this tutorial is Tk, this tutorial will keep things as simple
as possible, generally using a very direct coding style, rather than wrapping
up most of our code in procedures, modules, objects, classes and so on.  As much as 
possible, you'll also see the same names for objects, variables, etc. used across the
languages for each example.</p>

 <a name="walkthrough"></a><h2>Step-by-Step Walkthrough</h2>

<p>Let's take a closer look at that code, piece by piece.  For now, all we're trying to do is get a
basic understanding of the types of things we need to do to create a user interface in Tk, and
roughly what those things look like. We'll go into details later.</p>

<h3>Incorporating Tk</h3>

<p>Our program starts by incorporating Tk.</p>

<div class=python>
<pre>
from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk
</pre>
<p>These two lines tell Python that our program needs two modules. The first, <code>tkinter</code>, is the 
standard binding to Tk. When imported, it loads the Tk library on your system.
The second, <code>ttk</code>, is a submodule of <code>tkinter</code>. It implements Python's binding to the 
newer "themed widgets" that were added to Tk in 8.5.  </p>

<div class=tip><p>Notice that we've imported everything (<code>*</code>) from the tkinter module. That way, we can call tkinter functions etc. without
prefixing them with the module name. This is standard Tkinter practice.  
</p><p>
However, because we've imported just <code>ttk</code>
itself, we'll need to prefix anything inside that submodule.  For example, calling <code>Entry(...)</code>
would refer to the <code>Entry</code> class inside the <code>tkinter</code> module (classic widgets). We'd need <code>ttk.Entry(...)</code> to use the <code>Entry</code> class inside <code>ttk</code> (themed widgets).  
</p><p>
As you'll see, several classes are defined in both modules.
Sometimes you will need one or the other, depending on the context.  Explicitly requiring the <code>ttk</code> prefix facilitates this, and will be the style used
in this tutorial.</p></div>
</div>

<h3>Setting up the Main Application Window</h3>

<p>Next, the following code sets up the main application window, giving it the title "Feet to Meters."</p>

<div class=python><pre>root = Tk()
root.title("Feet to Meters")
</pre>
</div>

<h3>Creating a Content Frame</h3>

<p>Next, we create a frame widget, which will hold the contents of our user interface.</p>

<div class=python><pre>
mainframe = ttk.Frame(root, padding="3 3 12 12")
mainframe.grid(column=0, row=0, sticky=(N, W, E, S))
root.columnconfigure(0, weight=1)
root.rowconfigure(0, weight=1)	
</pre>
</div>


<p>After the frame is created, <code>grid</code> places it directly inside our main application window.
The <code>columnconfigure/rowconfigure</code> bits tell Tk that the frame should expand to fill any extra space
if the window is resized.</p>

<div class=upgrade><p>Why do we put a frame inside the main window?
  Strictly speaking, we could just put the other widgets in our interface directly into the main
application window, without the intervening content frame. That's what you'll see in older Tk programs. 
</p><p>
However, the main window isn't itself part of the newer "themed" widgets. Its background color doesn't match the themed widgets we
will put inside it.  Using a "themed" frame widget to hold the content ensures that the
background is correct. This is illustrated below.

<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/innerfrm.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Placing a themed frame inside a window.</p>

<p>On macOS, where this problem is most prominent, you can also set the window's background color (via its <code>background</code>
  configuration option) to the predefined color <code>systemWindowHeaderBackground</code>.
</p></div>

<h3>Creating the Entry Widget</h3>

<p>The first widget we'll create is the entry where we can input the number of feet that we want to convert.</p>
  
<div class=python><pre>feet = StringVar()
feet_entry = ttk.Entry(mainframe, width=7, textvariable=feet)
feet_entry.grid(column=2, row=1, sticky=(W, E))
</pre></div>

<p>We need to do two things: create the widget itself, and then place it onscreen.</p>
  
<p>When we create a widget, we need to specify its <em>parent</em>, which is the widget that this widget will be placed inside.
In this case, we want our entry placed inside the content frame. Our entry, and other widgets we'll create shortly, are said to be
<em>children</em> of the content frame. In Tcl and Perl, the widget name is used to specify the parent-child relationship, i.e. <code>.c.feet</code> is a child of <code>.c</code>. In Python and Ruby, the <code><em>parent</em></code> is passed as the first parameter when instantiating a widget object.
</p>

<p>When we create a widget, we can optionally provide it with certain <em>configuration options</em>. 
Here, we specify how wide we want the entry to appear, i.e. 7 characters. 
We also assign it a mysterious <code>textvariable</code>; we'll see what that does shortly.</p>

<p>When widgets are created, they don't automatically show up on the screen, because Tk doesn't know
how you want them to be placed relative to other widgets.  That's what the <code>grid</code> part does.
Remember the layout grid when we sketched out our application? Widgets are placed in the appropriate
column (1, 2, or 3), and row (also 1, 2, or 3).</p>

<p>The <code>sticky</code> option to grid describes how the widget should
line up within the grid cell, using compass directions.  So <code>w</code> (west) means to anchor the widget
to the left side of the cell, <code>we</code> (west-east) means to attach it to both the left and right sides,
and so on. Python also defines constants for these directional strings, which you can provide as a list, e.g. <code>W</code> or <code>(W, E)</code>.</p>
  
  
<h3>Creating the Remaining Widgets</h3>
  
<p>We then do exactly the same thing for the remaining widgets. We have one label that will display the resulting number of meters that we calculate. We have a "Calculate" button that is pressed to perform the calculation. Finally, we have three static text labels to
  make it clear how to use the application. For each of these widgets, we first create it and then place it onscreen in
  the appropriate cell in the grid.</p>
  
<div class=python><pre>
meters = StringVar()
ttk.Label(mainframe, textvariable=meters).grid(column=2, row=2, sticky=(W, E))

ttk.Button(mainframe, text="Calculate", command=calculate).grid(column=3, row=3, sticky=W)

ttk.Label(mainframe, text="feet").grid(column=3, row=1, sticky=W)
ttk.Label(mainframe, text="is equivalent to").grid(column=1, row=2, sticky=E)
ttk.Label(mainframe, text="meters").grid(column=3, row=2, sticky=W)
</pre></div>



<h3>Adding Some Polish</h3>

<p>We then put a few finishing touches on our user interface.</p>

<div class=python><pre>for child in mainframe.winfo_children(): 
    child.grid_configure(padx=5, pady=5)
feet_entry.focus()
root.bind("&lt;Return&gt;", calculate)
</pre></div>


<p>The first part walks through all of the widgets that are contained within our content frame,
and adds a little bit of padding around each, so they aren't so scrunched together.
(We could have added these options to each <code>grid</code> call when we first put the widgets
onscreen, but this is a nice shortcut.)</p>

<p>The second part tells Tk to put the focus on our entry widget.  That way, the cursor will
start in that field, so users don't have to click in it before starting to type.</p>

<p>The third line tells Tk that if a user presses the Return key (Enter on Windows) it should call our calculate routine, 
the same as if they pressed the Calculate button.</p>

<h3>Performing the Calculation</h3>

<p>Speaking of which, here we define our calculate procedure. It's called when a user presses
the Calculate button or hits the Return key.  It performs the feet to meters calculation.</p>

<div class=python><pre>def calculate(*args):
    try:
        value = float(feet.get())
        meters.set(int(0.3048 * value * 10000.0 + 0.5)/10000.0)
    except ValueError:
        pass
</pre></div>


<p>As you can clearly see, this routine takes the number of feet from our entry widget, does the calculation, 
and places the result in our label widget.</p>

<p>Say what?  It doesn't look like we're doing anything with those widgets!  Here's where
the magic <code>textvariable</code> options we specified when creating the widgets come into play.  
We specified the global variable <code>feet</code> as the textvariable for the entry, which means
that anytime the entry changes, Tk will <em>automatically</em> update the global variable <code>feet</code>.
Similarly, if we explicitly change the value of a textvariable associated with a widget
(as we're doing for <code>meters</code> which is attached to our label), the widget will automatically
be updated with the current contents of the variable. 
 
For Python, the only caveat is that these variables must be an instance of the <code>StringVar</code> class. 
Slick.</p>

<h3>Start the Event Loop</h3>

<p>Finally, we need to tell Tk to enter its event loop, which is necessary for everything to appear onscreen and allow users to
interact with it.</p>

<div class=python><pre>root.mainloop()</pre>
</div>



 <a name="missing"></a><h2>What's Missing</h2>

<p>We've now seen how to create widgets, put them onscreen, and respond to users interacting with them. It's certainly not fancy, could probably do with some error checking, but it's a fully-functional GUI application.</p>

<p>It's also worth examing what we <em>didn't</em> have to include in our Tk program to make
it work.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li> we didn't have to worry about redrawing the screen as things changed
<li> we didn't have to worry about parsing and dispatching events, hit detection, or handling events on each widget
<li> we didn't have to provide a lot of options when we created widgets; the defaults seemed
	 to take care of most things, and so we only had to change things like the text the button displayed
<li> we didn't have to write complex code to get and set the values of simple widgets; we just attached them to variables
<li> we didn't have to worry about what happens when users close the window or resizes it
<li> we didn't need to write extra code to get this all to work cross-platform
</ul>

<div class=python>
  <h3>One More Thing...</h3>
<p>As this tutorial emphasizes Tkinter, our examples use standalone script code, global variables, and simple functions. In practice, you'll likely organize
  anything beyond the simplest scripts in functions or classes. There are different ways to do this: using modules, creating classes for different parts of
  the user interface, inheriting from Tkinter classes, etc.</p>
<p> Often though, you just want to do something simple to encapsulate your data rather than putting everything into the global variable space. Here is the 
  feet to meters example, rewritten to encapsulate the main code into a class. Note the use of <code>self</code> on callbacks (which execute at the global scope)
  and <code>StringVar</code>'s.</p>
<pre>from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk

class FeetToMeters:

    def __init__(self, root):

        root.title("Feet to Meters")

        mainframe = ttk.Frame(root, padding="3 3 12 12")
        mainframe.grid(column=0, row=0, sticky=(N, W, E, S))
        root.columnconfigure(0, weight=1)
        root.rowconfigure(0, weight=1)
       
        self.feet = StringVar()
        feet_entry = ttk.Entry(mainframe, width=7, textvariable=self.feet)
        feet_entry.grid(column=2, row=1, sticky=(W, E))
        self.meters = StringVar()

        ttk.Label(mainframe, textvariable=self.meters).grid(column=2, row=2, sticky=(W, E))
        ttk.Button(mainframe, text="Calculate", command=self.calculate).grid(column=3, row=3, sticky=W)

        ttk.Label(mainframe, text="feet").grid(column=3, row=1, sticky=W)
        ttk.Label(mainframe, text="is equivalent to").grid(column=1, row=2, sticky=E)
        ttk.Label(mainframe, text="meters").grid(column=3, row=2, sticky=W)

        for child in mainframe.winfo_children(): 
            child.grid_configure(padx=5, pady=5)

        feet_entry.focus()
        root.bind("&lt;Return&gt;", self.calculate)
        
    def calculate(self, *args):
        try:
            value = float(self.feet.get())
            self.meters.set(int(0.3048 * value * 10000.0 + 0.5)/10000.0)
        except ValueError:
            pass

root = Tk()
FeetToMeters(root)
root.mainloop()</pre>
