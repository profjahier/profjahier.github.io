<h1>Basic Widgets</h1>


<p>This chapter introduces the basic Tk widgets that you'll find in just about any user interface:
frames, labels, buttons, checkbuttons, radiobuttons, entries, and comboboxes.  By the end,
you'll know how to use all the widgets you'd ever need for a typical fill-in-the-form
type of user interface.</p>

<p>You'll find it easiest to read this chapter (and those following that discuss more widgets) in order.  Because
there is so much commonality between many widgets, we'll introduce certain concepts when describing one
widget that will also apply to a widget we describe later.  Rather than going over the same ground multiple times,
we'll refer back to when the concept was first introduced.</p>

<p>At each widget is introduced, we'll 
refer to the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://tkdocs.com/widgets/index.html">widget roundup</a> page for the specific widget, as well as the 
<a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/contents.htm">Tk reference manual page</a>. 

As a reminder, this tutorial highlights the <em>most useful parts</em> of Tk and how to use
them to build effective modern user interfaces. The reference documentation, which details <em>everything</em> that can be
done in Tk, serves a very different purpose.</p>



 <a name="frame"></a><h2>Frame</h2>

<ul class=menu>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tkdocs.com/widgets/frame.html">Widget Roundup</a></li>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/ttk_frame.htm">Reference Manual</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A <b>frame</b> is a widget that displays as a simple rectangle.  Frames help to organize your user interface, often
  both visually and at the coding level. Frames often act as master widgets for a geometry manager like <code>grid</code>, 
  which manages the slave widgets contained within the frame.</p>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/w_frame_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Frame widgets.</p>

<div class=python><p>Frames are created using the <code><b>ttk.Frame</b></code> class:</p><pre>frame = ttk.Frame(<em>parent</em>)</pre></div>

<p>Frames can take several different configuration options, which can alter how they are displayed.</p>

<h4>Requested Size</h4>

<p>Typically, the size of a frame is determined by the size and layout of any widgets within it
  In turn, this is controlled by the geometry manager that manages the contents of the frame itself). </p>

<p>If, for some reason, you want an empty frame that does not contain other widgets, you can instead 
explicitly set its size using the 
<code>width</code> and/or <code>height</code> configuration options (otherwise, you'll end up with a
very small frame indeed).  </p>

<p>Screen distances such as width and height are usually specified as a number of pixels screen.  
You can also specify them via one of several suffixes.  For example, <code>350</code> means
350 pixels, <code>350c</code> means 350 centimeters, <code>350m</code> means 350 millimeters, <code>350i</code> means 350 inches, and <code>350p</code> means 350 printer's points (1/72 inch).</p>

<h4>Padding</h4>

<p>The <code>padding</code> configuration option is used to request extra space around the inside of
the widget. If you're putting other widgets inside the frame, there will be a bit of a
margin all the way around.  You can specify the same padding for all sides, different horizontal and
vertical padding, or padding for each side separately.</p>

<div class=python><pre>
f['padding'] = 5           <em># 5 pixels on all sides</em>
f['padding'] = (5,10)      <em># 5 on left and right, 10 on top and bottom</em>
f['padding'] = (5,7,10,12) <em># left: 5, top: 7, right: 10, bottom: 12</em>
</pre></div>

<h4>Borders</h4>

<p>You can display a border around a frame widget to visually separate it from its surroundings.
  You'll see this often used to make a part of the user interface look sunken or raised.  To do this,
you need to set the <code>borderwidth</code> configuration option (which defaults to 0, i.e., no border),
and the <code>relief</code> option, which specifies the visual appearance of the border. This can be one of:
<code>flat</code> (default), <code>raised</code>, <code>sunken</code>, <code>solid</code>, <code>ridge</code>, or <code>groove</code>.</p>

<div class=python><pre>frame['borderwidth'] = 2
frame['relief'] = 'sunken'</pre></div>
<h4>Changing Styles</h4>

<p>Frames have a <code>style</code> configuration option, which is common to all of the themed widgets.
This lets you control many other aspects of their appearance or behavior.  This is a bit more
advanced, so we won't go into it in too much detail right now. But here's a quick example of creating a "Danger"
frame with a red background and a raised border.</p>

<div class=python><pre>s = ttk.Style()
s.configure('Danger.TFrame', background='red', borderwidth=5, relief='raised')
ttk.Frame(root, width=200, height=200, style='Danger.TFrame').grid()</pre></div>

 <a name="label"></a><h2>Label</h2>

<ul class=menu>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tkdocs.com/widgets/label.html">Widget Roundup</a></li>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/ttk_label.htm">Reference Manual</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A <b>label</b> is a widget that displays text or images, typically that users will just
view but not otherwise interact with.  Labels are used for to identify
controls or other parts of the user interface, provide textual feedback or results, etc.</p>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/w_label_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Label widgets.</p>


<div class=python><p>Labels are created using the <code><b>ttk.Label</b></code> class. Often, the text or image the label will display are 
specified via configuration options at the same time:</p>
	<pre>label = ttk.Label(<em>parent</em>, text='Full name:')</pre></div>
<p>Like frames, labels can take several different configuration options, which can alter how they are displayed.</p>


<h4>Displaying Text</h4>

<p>The <code>text</code> configuration option (shown above when creating the label) is the most commonly used, particularly when
the label is purely decorative or explanatory.  You can change what text is displayed by modifying this configuration option.
This can be done at any time, not only when first creating the label.</p>

<p>You can also have the widget monitor a variable in your script. Anytime the variable changes, the label will
display the new value of the variable. This is done with the <code>textvariable</code> option:</p>

<div class=python><pre>resultsContents = StringVar()
label['textvariable'] = resultsContents
resultsContents.set('New value to display')</pre>
<p>Tkinter only allows you to attach widgets to an instance of the <code>StringVar</code> class, and not arbitrary Python variables.
This class contains all the
logic to watch for changes and communicate them back and forth between the variable and Tk.  Use the <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> methods
to read or write the current value of the variable.</p>
</div>
<h4>Displaying Images</h4>

<p>Labels can also display an image instead of text. If you just want an image displayed in your
user interface, this is normally the way to do it.  We'll go into images in more detail in a later chapter,
but for now, let's assume you want to display a GIF stored in a file on disk.  This
is a two-step process. First, you will create an image "object." Then, you can tell the label to use that object
via its <code>image</code> configuration option:</p>

<div class=python><pre>image = PhotoImage(file='myimage.gif')
label['image'] = image</pre></div>

<p>Labels can also display both an image and text at the same time. You'll often see this in toolbar buttons. To do so, use the 
<code>compound</code> configuration option.  The default value is <code>none</code>, meaning display
only the image if present; if there is no image, display the text specified by the <code>text</code> or
<code>textvariable</code> options.  Other possible values for the <code>compound</code> option are: <code>text</code> (text only), <code>image</code> (image only),
<code>center</code> (text in the center of image), <code>top</code> (image above text), <code>left</code>, <code>bottom</code>, and <code>right</code>.</p>


<h4>Fonts, Colors, and More</h4>

<p>Like with frames, you normally don't want to change things like fonts and colors directly.
If you need to change them (e.g., to create a special type of label), the preferred method would be to
create a new style, which is then used by the widget with the <code>style</code> option.</p>

<p>Unlike most themed widgets, the label widget also provides explicit widget-specific configuration options
as an alternative. Again, you should use these only in special one-off cases when using a style
didn't necessarily make sense.</p>

<p>You can specify the font used to display the label's text using the <code>font</code> configuration
option.  While we'll go into fonts in more detail in a later chapter, here are the names of some
predefined fonts you can use:</p>

<dl class="row ml-sm-1">
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>TkDefaultFont</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">Default for all GUI items not otherwise specified.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>TkTextFont</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">Used for entry widgets, listboxes, etc.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>TkFixedFont</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">A standard fixed-width font.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>TkMenuFont</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">The font used for menu items.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>TkHeadingFont</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">A font for column headings in lists and tables.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>TkCaptionFont</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">A font for window and dialog caption bars.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>TkSmallCaptionFont</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">Smaller captions for subwindows or tool dialogs.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>TkIconFont</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">A font for icon captions.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>TkTooltipFont</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">A font for tooltips.</dd>
</dl>

<div class=python><pre>label['font'] = "TkDefaultFont"</pre></div>
<p>The foreground (text) and background color of the label can also be changed via the <code>foreground</code> and
<code>background</code> configuration options.  Colors are covered in detail later, but you can specify them as either
color names (e.g., <code>red</code>) or hex RGB codes (e.g., <code>#ff340a</code>).</p>

<p>Labels also accept the <code>relief</code> configuration option discussed for frames to make them appear sunken or raised.</p>


<h4>Layout</h4>

<p>While the overall layout of the label (i.e., where it is positioned within the user interface,
and how large it is) is determined by the geometry manager, several options can
help you control how the label will be displayed within the rectangle the geometry manager gives it.</p>

<p>If the box given to the label is larger than the label requires for its contents, you can use
the <code>anchor</code> option to specify what edge or corner the label should be attached to,
which would leave any empty space in the opposite edge or corner.  Possible values are
specified as compass directions: <code>n</code> (north, or top edge), <code>ne</code>, (north-east, or top right corner),
<code>e</code>, <code>se</code>, <code>s</code>, <code>sw</code>, <code>w</code>, <code>nw</code> or <code>center</code>.  </p>


<h4>Multi-line Labels</h4>

<p>Labels can display more than one line of text.  To do so, embed carriage
returns (<code>\n</code>) in the <code>text</code> (or <code>textvariable</code>) string.  Labels can also 
automatically wrap your text into multiple lines via the <code>wraplength</code> option,
which specifies the maximum length of a line (in pixels, centimeters, etc.).</p>

<p>You can also control how the text is justified via the <code>justify</code> option. It
can have the values <code>left</code>, <code>center</code>, or <code>right</code>.  If you have only a single line of text, you
probably want the <code>anchor</code> option instead.</p>


 <a name="button"></a><h2>Button</h2>

<ul class=menu>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tkdocs.com/widgets/button.html">Widget Roundup</a></li>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/ttk_button.htm">Reference Manual</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A <b>button</b>, unlike a frame or label, is very much there to interact with. Users press a button to perform an action.  Like labels, they can display text or images, but accept additional options to change their behavior.</p>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/w_button_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Button widgets.</p>


<div class=python><p>Buttons are created using the <code><b>ttk.Button</b></code> class:</p>
		<pre>button = ttk.Button(<em>parent</em>, text='Okay', command=submitForm)</pre></div>
<p>Typically, their contents and command callback are specified at the same time. As with other widgets, buttons can take several different configuration options, including the standard <code>style</code> option,
which can alter their appearance and behavior.</p>


<h4>Text or Image</h4>

<p>Buttons take the same <code>text</code>, <code>textvariable</code> (rarely used), <code>image</code>, and <code>compound</code>
configuration options as labels. These control whether the button displays text and/or an image.</p>

<p>Buttons have a <code>default</code> configuration option. If specified as <code>active</code>, this tells Tk that the 
button is the default button in the user interface; otherwise it is <code>normal</code>. Default buttons are invoked
if users hit the Return or Enter key).  Some platforms and styles will draw this default button with
a different border or highlight.  Note that setting this option doesn't create an event binding that will make the Return or Enter key
activate the button; that you have to do yourself.</p>


<h4>The Command Callback</h4>

<p>The <code>command</code> option connects the button's action and your application.
When a user presses the button, the script provided by the option is evaluated by the interpreter.</p>

<p>You can also ask the button to invoke the command callback from your application.  That way, you don't
need to repeat the command to be invoked several times in your program. If you change the command attached to the
button, you don't need to change it elsewhere too. Sounds like a useful way to add that event binding on our default
button, doesn't it?</p>

<div class=python><pre>action = ttk.Button(root, text="Action", default="active", command=myaction)
root.bind('&lt;Return&gt;', lambda e: action.invoke())</pre></div>

<div class=tip><p>Standard behavior for dialog boxes and many other windows on most platforms is to set up a binding on
  the window for the Return key (<code>&lt;Return&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Key-Return&gt;</code>) to invoke the active button if it exists,
  as we've done here. If there is a "Close" or "Cancel" button, create a binding to the Escape key (<code>&lt;Key-Escape&gt;</code>).
  On macOS, you should additionally bind the Enter key on the keyboard (<code>&lt;KP_Enter&gt;</code>) to the active
  button, and Command-period (<code>&lt;Command-.&gt;</code>) to the close or cancel button.</p></div>

<h4>Button State</h4>

<p>Buttons and many other widgets start off in a normal state. A button will respond to mouse movements, can be pressed, and
will invoke its command callback. Buttons can also be put into
a disabled state, where the button is greyed out, does not respond to mouse movements, and cannot be pressed.  
Your program would disable the button when its command is not applicable at a given point in time.</p>

<p>All themed widgets maintain an internal state, represented as a series of binary flags.  Each flag can either be set (on) or cleared (off).
You can set or clear these different flags, and check the current setting using the <code>state</code> and <code>instate</code> methods.  
Buttons make use of the <code>disabled</code> flag to control whether or not users can press the button.  For example:</p>


<div class=python><pre>
b.state(['disabled'])          <em># set the disabled flag</em>
b.state(['!disabled'])         <em># clear the disabled flag</em>
b.instate(['disabled'])        <em># true if disabled, else false</em>
b.instate(['!disabled'])       <em># true if not disabled, else false</em>
b.instate(['!disabled'], cmd)  <em># execute 'cmd' if not disabled</em>
</pre>
<div class=tip><p>Note that these commands accept an <b>array</b> of state flags as their argument.</p></div>
</div>


<p>The full list of state flags available to themed widgets is: <code>active</code>, <code>disabled</code>, <code>focus</code>, <code>pressed</code>, <code>selected</code>,
<code>background</code>, <code>readonly</code>, <code>alternate</code>, and <code>invalid</code>.  These are described in the
<a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/ttk_widget.htm">themed widget reference</a>. While all widgets have the same set of state flags, not all states
are meaningful for all widgets.  It's also possible to get fancy in the <code>state</code> and <code>instate</code> methods
and specify multiple state flags at the same time.
</p>

<div class=upgrade><p>The <code>state</code> and <code>instate</code> methods replace the older <code>state</code> configuration option (which took the values <code>normal</code> or
<code>disabled</code>).  
</p><p>
That configuration option is actually still available for themed widgets in Tk 8.5, but "write-only," which means that
changing the option calls the appropriate <code>state</code> command.  It's mainly intended as a convenience so you can
specify a widget should be disabled when you first create it. However, any changes made using the new <code>state</code>
command do not update the configuration option.  To avoid confusion, you should update your code to 
use the new state flags for all themed widgets.</p></div>	



 
 <a name="checkbutton"></a><h2>Checkbutton</h2>

<ul class=menu>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tkdocs.com/widgets/checkbutton.html">Widget Roundup</a></li>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/ttk_checkbutton.htm">Reference Manual</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A <b>checkbutton</b> widget is like a regular button that also holds a binary value of some kind (i.e., a toggle).  
When pressed, a checkbutton flips the toggle and then invokes its callback.
Checkbutton widgets are frequently used to allow users to turn an option on or off.</p>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/w_checkbutton_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Checkbutton widgets.</p>


<div class=python><p>Checkbuttons are created using the <code><b>ttk.Checkbutton</b></code> class. Typically, their contents and behavior are specified at the same time:</p>
		<pre>measureSystem = StringVar()
check = ttk.Checkbutton(<em>parent</em>, text='Use Metric', 
	    command=metricChanged, variable=measureSystem,
	    onvalue='metric', offvalue='imperial')</pre></div>

<p>Checkbuttons use many of the same options as regular buttons but add a few more.  The <code>text</code>, <code>textvariable</code>,
<code>image</code>, and <code>compound</code> configuration options control the display of the label (next to the checkbox itself). 
Similarly, the <code>command</code> option lets you specify a command to be called every time a user toggles the checkbutton; and the 
<code>invoke</code> method will also execute the same command.
The <code>state</code> and <code>instate</code> methods allow you to manipulate the <code>disabled</code> state flag to enable or disable the checkbutton.  </p>

<h4>Widget Value</h4>

<p>Unlike regular buttons, checkbuttons also hold a value.  We've seen before how the <code>textvariable</code> option can link
the label of a widget to a variable in your program. The <code>variable</code> option for checkbuttons behaves similarly, except
it links a variable to current value of the widget. The variable is updated whenever the widget is toggled.  By default, 
checkbuttons use a value of <code>1</code> when the widget is checked, and <code>0</code> when not checked. These can be changed to 
something else using the <code>onvalue</code> and <code>offvalue</code> options.</p>

<p>A checkbutton doesn't automatically set (or create) the linked variable. Therefore, your program needs to initialize it 
to the appropriate starting value.</p>

<p>What happens when the linked variable contains neither the <code>onvalue</code> or the <code>offvalue</code> (or even doesn't exist)?  In that case,
the checkbutton is put into a special "tristate" or indeterminate mode. When in this mode, the checkbox might display a single dash, instead of 
being empty or holding a checkmark.  Internally, the state flag <code>alternate</code> is set, which you can inspect
via the <code>instate</code> method:</p>

<div class=python><pre>check.instate(['alternate'])</pre></div>

<div class=python>
<p>While we've been using an instance of the <code>StringVar</code> class, Tkinter provides other
variable classes that can hold booleans, integers, or floating-point numbers. You can always
use a <code>StringVar</code> (because the Tcl API that Tkinter uses is string-based) but can choose one of the others if 
the data that will be stored in it fits the type. All are subclasses of the base class <code>Variable</code>.
</p><p>
We saw in the feet to meters example that you can call the <code>get</code> method of a <code>Variable</code> to retrieve its value or
the <code>set</code> method to provide a new value. You can also supply an initial value when you instantiate it.</p>
<pre>
s = StringVar(value="abc")   <em># default value is ''</em>
b = BooleanVar(value=True)   <em># default is False</em>
i = IntVar(value=10)         <em># default is 0</em>
d = DoubleVar(value=10.5)    <em># default is 0.0</em>
</pre>
</div>




 <a name="radiobutton"></a><h2>Radiobutton</h2>

<ul class=menu>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tkdocs.com/widgets/radiobutton.html">Widget Roundup</a></li>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/ttk_radiobutton.htm">Reference Manual</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A <b>radiobutton</b> widget lets you choose between one of several mutually exclusive choices.
Unlike a checkbutton, they are not limited to just two options.  Radiobuttons are always used 
together in a set, where multiple radiobutton widgets are tied to a single choice or preference.
They are appropriate to use when the number of options is relatively small, e.g., 3-5.</p>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/w_radiobutton_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Radiobutton widgets.</p>


<div class=python><p>Radiobuttons are created using the <code><b>ttk.Radiobutton</b></code> class. Typically, you'll create and initialize several of them at once:</p>
	<pre>phone = StringVar()
home = ttk.Radiobutton(<em>parent</em>, text='Home', variable=phone, value='home')
office = ttk.Radiobutton(<em>parent</em>, text='Office', variable=phone, value='office')
cell = ttk.Radiobutton(<em>parent</em>, text='Mobile', variable=phone, value='cell')</pre></div>

<p>Radiobuttons share most of the same configuration options as checkbuttons.  One exception is that the 
<code>onvalue</code> and <code>offvalue</code> options are replaced with a single <code>value</code> option.
Each radiobutton in the set will have the same linked variable, but a different value. 
When the variable holds the matching value, that radiobutton will visually indicate it is selected. 
If it doesn't match, the radiobutton will be unselected.  
If the linked variable doesn't exist, or you don't specify one with the <code>variable</code> option,
radiobuttons also display as "tristate" or indeterminate. This can be checked via the <code>alternate</code> state flag.</p>



 <a name="entry"></a><h2>Entry</h2>

<ul class=menu>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tkdocs.com/widgets/entry.html">Widget Roundup</a></li>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/ttk_entry.htm">Reference Manual</a></li>
</ul>

<p>An <b>entry</b> widget presents users with a single line text field where they can
type in a string value.  These can be just about anything: a name, a city, a password, social 
security number, etc.</p>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/w_entry_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Entry widgets.</p>


<div class=python><p>Entries are created using the <code><b>ttk.Entry</b></code> class:</p>
	<pre>username = StringVar()
name = ttk.Entry(<em>parent</em>, textvariable=username)</pre></div>

<p>A <code>width</code> configuration option may be specified to provide the number of
characters wide the entry should be. This allows you, for example, to display a shorter
entry for a zip or postal code.</p>

<h4>Entry Contents</h4>

<p>We've seen how checkbutton and radiobutton widgets have a value associated with them.
Entries do as well, and that value is usually accessed through a linked variable
specified by the <code>textvariable</code> configuration option. </p>

<div class=tip><p>Unlike the various buttons, entries don't have a text or image beside them to
identify them. Use a separate label widget for that.</p></div>

<p>You can also get or change the value of the entry widget without going
through the linked variable.  The <code>get</code> method returns the current value, and
the <code>delete</code> and <code>insert</code> methods let you change the contents, e.g.</p>

<div class=python><pre>print('current value is %s' % name.get())
name.delete(0,'end')          <em># delete between two indices, 0-based</em>
name.insert(0, 'your name')   <em># insert new text at a given index</em></pre></div>

<h4>Watching for Changes</h4>

<p>Entry widgets don't have a <code>command</code> option to invoke a
callback whenever the entry is changed.  To watch for changes, you should watch
for changes to the linked variable. See also "Validation", below.</p>

<div class=python>
<pre>
def it_has_been_written(*args):
    ...
username.trace_add("write", it_has_been_written)
</pre>

</div>

<p>You'll be fine if you stick with simple uses of <code>trace_add</code> like that shown above. You might want to know that
this is a small part of a much more complex system for observing variables and invoking callbacks when they are read, written,
or deleted. You can trigger multiple callbacks, add or delete them (<code>trace_remove</code>), and introspect 
them (<code>trace_info</code>).</p>

<div class=upgrade><p>These methods also replace a now-deprecated set of older methods (<code>trace</code>, <code>trace_variable</code>, <code>trace_vdelete</code>,
and <code>trace_vinfo</code>) that should not be used.</p></div>

<div class=python>Tkinter allows you to watch for changes on a <code>StringVar</code> (or any subclass of <code>Variable</code>).
  Both the older and newer tracing tools are a very thin (and not terribly Pythonic) front end to Tcl's <a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/trace.htm"><code>trace</code></a> command.</p>

</div>


<h4>Passwords</h4>

<p>Entries can be used for passwords, where the actual contents are displayed as a bullet or other symbol.
To do this, set the <code>show</code> configuration option to the character you'd like to display.</p>

<div class=python><pre>passwd = ttk.Entry(<em>parent</em>, textvariable=password, show="*")</pre></div>

<h4>Widget States</h4>

<p>Like the various buttons, entries can also be put into a disabled state via the <code>state</code> command (and queried
with <code>instate</code>).  Entries can also use the state flag <code>readonly</code>; if set, users cannot change the entry,
though they can still select the text in it (and copy it to the clipboard).  There is also an <code>invalid</code>
state, set if the entry widget fails validation, which leads us to...</p>

<h3>Validation</h3>

<p>Users can type any text they like into an entry widget. However, if you'd like to restrict what they can type into the
  entry, you can do so with <em>validation</em>. For example, an entry might only accept an integer or a valid zip or
  postal code.</p>
  
<p>Your program can specify what makes an entry valid or invalid, as well as when to check its validity. As we'll see soon, the two 
  are related. We'll start with a simple example, an entry that can only hold an integer up to five digits long. </p>
  
<p>The validation criteria is specified via an entry's <code>validatecommand</code> configuration option. You supply a piece of
  code whose job is to validate the entry. It functions like a widget callback or event binding, except that it returns
  a value (whether or not the entry is valid). We'll arrange to validate the entry on any keystroke, which 
  is specified by providing a value of <code>key</code> to the <code>validate</code> configuration option.</p> 
  
<div class=python><pre>import re
def check_num(newval):
    return re.match('^[0-9]*$', newval) is not None and len(newval) &lt;= 5
check_num_wrapper = (root.register(check_num), '%P')

num = StringVar()
e = ttk.Entry(root, textvariable=num, validate='key', validatecommand=check_num_wrapper)
e.grid(column=0, row=0, sticky='we')
</pre></div>

  
<p>A few things are worth noting. First, as with event bindings, we can access more information about the conditions that 
  triggered the validation via <em>percent substitutions.</em> We used one of these here:
  <code>%P</code> is the new value of the entry <em>if</em> the validation passes. We'll use a simple regular expression and a length
  check to determine if the change is valid. To reject the change, our validation command can 
  return a false value, and the entry will remain unchanged.</p>

<div class=python>
<p>Taking advantage of these percent substitutions requires a bit of gymnastics. You'll recall that Tkinter abstracts away percent 
  substitutions in event binding callbacks. There, all of the event parameters are wrapped into an event object which is always passed to the
  callback. There's not an equivalent abstraction for validation callbacks. Instead, we have to choose which percent substitutions 
  we're interested in. The <code>register</code> method (which can be called on any widget, not just 
  <code>root</code>) creates a Tcl procedure which will call our Python function. The percent substitutions we've chosen will be
  passed to it as parameters.</p>
</div> 

<p>Let's extend our example so that the entry will accept a US zip code, formatted as "#####" or "#####-####" ("#" can be any digit).
We'll still do some validation on each keystroke (only allowing entry of numbers or a hyphen). However, We can no longer fully validate 
the entry on every keystroke; if they've just typed the first digit, it's not valid yet. So full validation will
only happen when the entry loses focus (e.g., a user tabs away from it). Tk refers to this as <em>revalidation</em>, in contrast
  with <em>prevalidation</em> (accepting changes on each keystroke).</p>

<p>How should we respond to errors? Let's add a message reminding users of the format. It will appear if they type a wrong key or tab away
from the entry when it's not holding a valid zip code. We'll remove the message when they return to the entry or type a valid key.
We'll also add a (dummy) button to "process" the zip code, which will be disabled 
unless the zip entry is valid. Finally, we'll also add a "name" entry so you can tab away from the zip entry.</p>

<div class=python><pre>import re
errmsg = StringVar()
formatmsg = "Zip should be ##### or #####-####"

def check_zip(newval, op):
    errmsg.set('')
    valid = re.match('^[0-9]{5}(\-[0-9]{4})?$', newval) is not None
    btn.state(['!disabled'] if valid else ['disabled'])
    if op=='key':
        ok_so_far = re.match('^[0-9\-]*$', newval) is not None and len(newval) &lt;= 10
        if not ok_so_far:
            errmsg.set(formatmsg)
        return ok_so_far
    elif op=='focusout':
        if not valid:
            errmsg.set(formatmsg)
    return valid
check_zip_wrapper = (root.register(check_zip), '%P', '%V')

zip = StringVar()
f = ttk.Frame(root)
f.grid(column=0, row=0)
ttk.Label(f, text='Name:').grid(column=0, row=0, padx=5, pady=5)
ttk.Entry(f).grid(column=1, row=0, padx=5, pady=5)
ttk.Label(f, text='Zip:').grid(column=0, row=1, padx=5, pady=5)
e = ttk.Entry(f, textvariable=zip, validate='all', validatecommand=check_zip_wrapper)
e.grid(column=1, row=1, padx=5, pady=5)
btn = ttk.Button(f, text="Process")
btn.grid(column=2, row=1, padx=5, pady=5)
btn.state(['disabled'])
msg = ttk.Label(f, font='TkSmallCaptionFont', foreground='red', textvariable=errmsg)
msg.grid(column=1, row=2, padx=5, pady=5, sticky='w')
</pre></div>

<p>Notice that the <code>validate</code> configuration option has been changed from <code>key</code> to <code>all</code>.
That arranges for the <code>validatecommand</code> callback to be invoked on not only keystrokes but other triggers.
The trigger is passed to the callback using the <code>%V</code> percent substitution.
The callback differentiated between <code>key</code> and <code>focusout</code> triggers (you can also check for <code>focusin</code>).</p>

<div class=fyi><p>There's a few more things to know about validation. First, if your <code>validatecommand</code> ever generates an error 
(or doesn't return a boolean), validation will be disabled for that widget. Your callback can modify the entry, e.g.,
change its textvariable. You can ask the widget to validate at any time by calling
it's <code>validate</code> method, which returns true if validation passes (the <code>%V</code> substitution is set to <code>forced</code>).
</p><p>
There is an <code>invalidcommand</code> configuration option (which works like <code>validatecommand</code>) that is called whenever 
validation fails. You can use it to accomplish nasty things like forcing the focus back on the widget that didn't validate. 
In practice, it's rarely used. As mentioned earlier, the entry's <code>invalid</code> state flag (which can be checked via
the <code>instate invalid</code> method) is automatically updated as validation succeeds or fails.
</p><p>
Other percent substitutions allow you to get the entry's contents prior to editing (<code>%s</code>), differentiate between insert and delete (<code>%d</code>), where an insert or delete occurs (<code>%i</code>), what is being inserted or deleted (<code>%S</code>), the
current setting of the <code>validate</code> option (<code>%v</code>) and the name of the widget (<code>%W</code>).

 <a name="combobox"></a><h2>Combobox</h2>

<ul class=menu>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tkdocs.com/widgets/combobox.html">Widget Roundup</a></li>
<li><a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/ttk_combobox.htm">Reference Manual</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A <b>combobox</b> widget combines an entry with a list of choices.  This lets users
either choose from a set of values you've provided (e.g., typical settings), but also put in their
own value (e.g., for less common cases).</p>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/w_combobox_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Combobox widgets.</p>


<div class=python><p>Comboboxes are created using the <code><b>ttk.Combobox</b></code> class:</p>
		<pre>countryvar = StringVar()
country = ttk.Combobox(<em>parent</em>, textvariable=countryvar)</pre></div>

<p>Like entries, the <code>textvariable</code> option links a variable in your program to the
current value of the combobox.  As with other widgets, you should initialize
the linked variable in your own code. </p>

<p>A combobox will generate a <code>&lt;&lt;ComboboxSelected&gt;&gt;</code> virtual event that you can bind to whenever its value changes.
  (You could also trace changes on the <code>textvariable</code>, as we've seen in the previous few widgets we covered.
  Binding to the event is more straightforward, and so tends to be our preferred choice.)</p>

<div class=python><pre>country.bind('&lt;&lt;ComboboxSelected&gt;&gt;', <em>function</em>)</pre></div>

<h4>Predefined Values</h4>

<p>You can provide a list of values that users can choose from using the <code>values</code> configuration
option:</p>

<div class=python><pre>country['values'] = ('USA', 'Canada', 'Australia')</pre></div>

<p>If set, the <code>readonly</code> state flag will restrict users to making choices only from the list
of predefined values, but not be able to enter their own (though if the current value of the
combobox is not in the list, it won't be changed).  </p>

<div class=python><pre>country.state(["readonly"])</pre></div>

<div class=tip><p>If you're using the combobox in <code>readonly</code> mode, I'd recommend
that when the value changes (i.e., on a <code>&lt;&lt;ComboboxSelected&gt;&gt;</code> event), that
you call the <code>selection_clear</code> method. It looks a bit odd visually 
without doing that.</p></div>


<p>You can also get the current value using the <code>get</code> method, and change the current value using the <code>set</code> 
method (which takes a single argument, the new value).</p>

<p>As a complement to the <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> methods, you can also use the <code>current</code> method to determine
which item in the predefined values list is selected. Call <code>current</code> with no arguments; it will
return a 0-based index into the list, or -1 if the current value is not in the list. You can select
an item in the list by calling <code>current</code> with a single 0-based index argument.</p>

<div class=tip><p>Want to associate some other value with each item in the list so that your program can use one value internally,
but it gets displayed in the combobox as something else?  You'll want to have a look at
the section entitled "Keeping Extra Item Data" when we get to the discussion of listboxes in a couple of 
chapters from now.</p></div>
