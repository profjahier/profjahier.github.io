<h1>Styles and Themes</h1>


<p>The <em>themed</em> aspect of the modern Tk widgets is one of the most powerful and exciting aspects of the newer
widget set.  Yet, it's also one of the most confusing.</p>

<p>This chapter explains styles (which control how widgets like buttons look) and themes (which are a collection
  of styles that define how all the widgets in your application look). Changing themes can give your application an
  entirely different look.</p>
  
<p class=picture>

Applying different themes.</p>  

<p>Note that it's not just colors that have changed, but the actual shape of individual widgets. Styles and themes are <em>extremely</em> flexible.</p>

  
<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>However, before you get carried away, very few applications will benefit from switching themes like this. Some games or educational
programs might be exceptions. Using the standard Tk theme for a given platform will display widgets the way that people expect to see them, 
particularly if they're running macOS and Windows.</p>

<div class=fyi><p>On Linux systems, there's far less standardization of look and feel. Users expect (and are more comfortable with) some
  variability and "coolness." Because different widget sets (typically GTK and QT) are used by window managers, control panels, and other system 
  utilities, Tk can't seamlessly blend in with the current settings on any particular system. Most of the Linux screenshots in this
  tutorial use Tk's <code>alt</code> theme. Despite users being accustomed to variability, there are limits to what most users will accept.
  The styling of core widgets in Tk's classic widget set, matching circa-1992 OSF/Motif, is a prime example.</p></div>

<p>Styles and themes, used in a more targeted manner and with significant restraint, can have a role to play in modern applications.
  This chapter explains why and when you might want to use them and how to go about doing so. We'll begin by drawing a parallel 
  between Tk's styles and themes and another realm of software development.</p>

<h3>Understanding Styles and Themes</h3>


<p>If you're familiar with web development, you know about cascading stylesheets (CSS). There are two ways it can be used to customize
  the appearance of an element in your HTML page. In the first way, you add a bunch of style attributes (fonts, colors, borders, etc.) directly 
  to an element in your HTML code via the <code>style</code> attribute. For example:</p>
<pre>
&lt;label style="color:red; font-size:14pt; font-weight:bold; background-color:yellow;"&gt;Meltdown imminent!&lt;/label&gt;
</pre>  

<p>The other way to use CSS is to attach a <em>class</em> to each widget via the <code>class</code> attribute. 
  The details of how elements of that class appear are provided elsewhere, often in a separate CSS file.  
  You can attach the same class to many elements, and they will all have the same appearance. You don't need to repeat
  the full details for every element. More importantly, you separate the logical content of your site (HTML) from its
  appearance (CSS).</p>

<pre>
&lt;label class="danger"&gt;Meltdown imminent!&lt;/label&gt;
...
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
label.danger {color:red; font-size:14pt; font-weight:bold; background-color:yellow;}
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>
  
<p>Back to Tk.</p>
<ul><li>In the classic Tk widgets, all appearance customizations require specifying each detail on individual widgets,
  akin to <em>always</em> using the <code>style</code> HTML attribute.</li>
  <li>In the themed Tk widgets, <em>all</em> appearance customizations are made via attaching a style to a widget, akin to using
    the <code>class</code> HTML attribute. Separately, you define how widgets with that style will appear, akin to writing CSS.</li>
  <li>Unlike with HTML, <em>you can't freely mix and match.</em> You can't customize some themed entries or buttons with styles, and others
    by directly changing appearance options.</li> 
</ul>

<div class=fyi><p>Yes, there are a few exceptions, like labels where you can customize the font and colors through both styles and configuration options.</p></div>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p>So why use styles and themes in Tk? They take the fine-grained details of appearance decisions away from individual instances of widgets.</p>

<p>That makes for cleaner code and less repetition. If you have 20 entry widgets in your application, you don't need to repeat the same 
  appearance details every time you create one (or write a wrapper function). You just assign them a style.</p>
  
<p>Styles also put all appearance decisions in one place. And because styles for a button and styles for a widget can share common elements, it
  promotes consistency and improves reuse.</p>

<div class=fyi><p>Styles also have many benefits for widget authors. Widgets can delegate most appearance decisions to styles.
  A widget author no longer has to hardcode logic to the effect of "when the state is disabled, consult the 'disabledforeground' 
  configuration option and use that for the foreground color."  Not only did that make coding widgets longer (and more repetitive),
  but it also restricted how a widget could be changed based on its state. If the widget author hadn't coded in logic to change the font 
  when the state changed, you as an application developer using the widget were out of luck.
</p><p>
  Using styles, widget authors don't need to provide code for every possible appearance option. That not only simplifies the widget but 
  paradoxically ensures that a wider range of appearances <b>can</b> be set, including those the widget author may not have anticipated.
</p></div>



 <a name="usetheme"></a><h2>Using Existing Themes</h2>

<p>Before delving into the weightier matters of tastefully and selectively modifying and applying styles to improve the usability of
  your application and cleanliness of your code, let's deal with the fun bits: using existing themes to completely reskin your application.</p>

<p>Themes are identified by a name.  You can obtain the names of all available themes:</p>

<div class=python><pre>>>> <b>s = ttk.Style()</b>
>>> <b>s.theme_names()</b>
('aqua', 'step', 'clam', 'alt', 'default', 'classic')</pre>
<div class=fyi><p>Tkinter encapsulates all style manipulations in the <code>ttk.Style</code> class. We'll therefore need an instance of that
  class for this and other operations.</p></div>
</div>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/w_several_themes.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Built-in themes.</p>

<p>Besides the built-in themes (<code>alt</code>, <code>default</code>, <code>clam</code>, and <code>classic</code>), macOS includes a theme named
  <code>aqua</code> to match the system-wide style, while Windows includes themes named <code>vista</code>, <code>winxpnative</code>, and 
  <code>winnative</code>.</p>

<p>Only one theme can ever be active at a time.  To obtain the name of the theme currently in use, use the following:</p>


<div class=python><pre>>>> <b>s.theme_use()</b>
'aqua'</pre></div>


<div class=fyi><p>This API, which was originally targeted for Tk 8.6, was back-ported to Tk 8.5.9.  If you're using an earlier version of Tk
getting this info is a bit trickier.</p></div>

<p>Switching to a new theme can be done with:</p>

<div class=python><pre>s.theme_use('<em>themename</em>')</pre></div>


<p>What does this actually do?  Obviously, it sets the current theme to the indicated theme.  Doing this,
therefore, replaces all the currently available styles with the set of styles defined by the theme.
Finally, it refreshes all widgets, so that they take on the appearance described by the new theme.</p>

  
 <a name="usingstyles"></a><h2>Using Styles</h2>

<p>We'll now tackle the more difficult issue of how to take full advantage of styles and themes within your application, not just reskinning it
  with an existing theme.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>

<p>We first need to introduce a few essential concepts.</p>

<h4>Widget Class</h4>
	
<p>A <em>widget class</em> identifies the type of a particular widget, whether
it is a button, a label, a canvas, etc. All themed widgets have a default class. Buttons have the class <code>TButton</code>,
labels <code>TLabel</code>, etc.</p>


<h4>Widget State</h4>

<p>A <em>widget state</em> allows a single widget to have more than one appearance or behavior,
depending on things like mouse position, different state options set by the application, and so on.</p>

<p>As you'll recall, all themed widgets maintain a set of binary state flags, accessed by the <code>state</code> and <code>instate</code> methods.
The flags are: <code>active</code>, <code>disabled</code>, <code>focus</code>, <code>pressed</code>,
<code>selected</code>, <code>background</code>, <code>readonly</code>, <code>alternate</code>, and <code>invalid</code>.
All widgets have the same set of state flags, though they may ignore some of them (e.g., a label widget would
likely ignore an <code>invalid</code> state flag). See the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/ttk_widget.htm">themed widget</a> page 
in the reference manual for the exact meaning of each state flag.</p>



<h4>Style</h4>

<p>A <em>style</em> describes the appearance (or appearance<em>s</em>) of a widget class.  
  All themed widgets having the same widget class will have the same appearance(s).</p>
<p>Styles are referred to by the name of the widget class they describe. For example,
  the style <code>TButton</code> defines the appearance of all widgets with the class <code>TButton</code>.

<p>Styles know about different states, and one style can define different appearances based on a widget's state.
For example, a style can specify how a widget's appearance should change if the <code>pressed</code> state flag is set.</p>

<h4>Theme</h4>

<p>A <em>theme</em> is a collection of styles.  While each style is widget-specific (one for buttons, one for
entries, etc.), a theme collects many styles together.  All styles in the same theme will be designed to 
visually "fit" together with each other. (Tk doesn't technically restrict bad design or judgment, unfortunately!)</p>

<p>Using a particular theme in an application really means that, by default, the appearance of each
  widget will be controlled by the style within that theme responsible for that widget class.</p>



<h3>Style Names</h3>
<p>Every style has a name.  If you're going to modify a style, create a new one, or use a style for a widget,
you need to know its name.</p>

<p>How do you know what the names of the styles are?  If you have a particular widget, and you want to know
what style it is currently using, you can first check the value of its <code>style</code> configuration option.  If
that is empty, it means the widget is using the <em>default</em> style for the widget.  You can retrieve
that via the widget's class.  For example:</p>

<div class=python><pre>>>> <b>b = ttk.Button()</b>
>>> <b>b['style']</b>
''
>>> <b>b.winfo_class()</b>
'TButton'</pre></div>


<p>In this case, the style that is being used is <code>TButton</code>.  The default styles for other themed widgets
are named similarly, e.g., <code>TEntry</code>, <code>TLabel</code>, etc.</p>

<div class=tip><p>It's always wise to check the specifics. For example, the treeview widget's class is <code>Treeview</code>, <b>not</b> <code>TTreeview</code>.</p></div>

<p>Beyond the default styles, though, styles can be named pretty much anything.  You might create your own style
(or use a theme that has a style) named <code>FunButton</code>, <code>NuclearReactorButton</code>, or even <code>GuessWhatIAm</code> (not a 
smart choice).</p>

<p>More often, you'll find names like <code>Fun.TButton</code> or <code>NuclearReactor.TButton</code>, which suggest
variations of a base style; as you'll see, this is something Tk supports for creating and modifying styles.</p>

<div class=yuck><p>The ability to retrieve a list of all currently available styles is currently not supported.
  This will likely appear in Tk 8.7 in the form of a new command, <code>ttk::style theme styles</code>
  to return the list of styles implemented by a theme. It also proposes adding a <code>style</code> method
  for all widgets, so you don't have to examine both the widget's <code>style</code> configuration option and
  its class. See <a href="../../external.html?link=https://tip.tcl.tk/584">TIP #584</a>.
</p></div>


<h3>Applying a Style</h3>

<p>To use a style means to apply that style to an individual widget.  If you know the name of the style you
want to use, and which widget to apply it to, it's easy.  Setting the style can be done at creation time:</p>

<div class=python><pre>b = ttk.Button(<em>parent</em>, text='Hello', style='Fun.TButton')</pre></div>

<p>As well, a widget's style can be changed at any time with the <code>style</code> configuration option:</p>

<div class=python><pre>b['style'] = 'Emergency.TButton'</pre></div>


<h3>Creating a Simple Style</h3>

<p>So how do we create a new style like <code>Emergency.TButton</code>?</p>

<p>In situations like this, you're creating a new style similar to an existing one but varies
in a certain aspect. This is the most common reason for creating new styles.</p>

<p>For example, you want most of the buttons in your application to keep their normal appearance, but have
  certain "emergency" buttons highlighted differently.  Creating a new style (e.g., <code>Emergency.TButton</code>),
  derived from the base style (<code>TButton</code>), is the appropriate thing to do.</p>

<p>Prepending another name (<code>Emergency</code>) followed  by a dot onto an existing style creates a new style  
  derived from the existing one. The new style will have exactly the same options as the existing one except for the indicated differences:</p>

<div class=python><pre>s.configure('Emergency.TButton', font='helvetica 24', foreground='red', padding=10)</pre></div>

<p>You could then apply that style to an individual button widget using its <code>style</code> configuration option,
  as shown earlier. Every other button widget would retain its normal appearance.</p>

<p>How do you know what options are available to change for a given style? That requires diving a little deeper inside styles.</p> 

 <a name="styleoptions"></a><h2>Manipulating Styles</h2>

<p>In this section, we'll see how to change the style's appearance by modifying style options.
You can do this either by modifying an existing style, or more typically, by creating a new style.
We saw how to create a simple style that was derived from another one earlier:</p>

<div class=python><pre>s.configure('Emergency.TButton', font='helvetica 24', foreground='red', padding=10)</pre></div>


<h3>Modifying a Style Option</h3>

<p>Modifying an option for an existing style is done in a similar fashion as modifying any other
configuration option, by specifying the style, name of the option, and new value:</p>

<div class=python><pre>s.configure('TButton', font='helvetica 24')</pre></div>

<p>You'll learn more about what the valid options are shortly.</p>

<div class=tip><p>If you modify an existing style, like we've done here with <code>TButton</code>, that modification will apply to all widgets using
that style (so by default, all buttons).  That may well be what you want to do.</p></div>

<p>To retrieve the current value of an option, use the <code>lookup</code> method:</p>

<div class=python><pre>>>> <b>s.lookup('TButton', 'font')</b>
'helvetica 24'</pre></div>



<h3>State Specific Style Options</h3>
<p>Besides the normal configuration options for the style, the widget author may have specified different options to 
use when the widget is in a particular widget state.  For example, when a button is disabled, it may change 
the button's label to grey.</p>

<div class=tip><p>Remember that the state is composed of one or more state flags (or their negation), as set by the widget's <code>state</code> method,
or queried via the <code>instate</code> method.</p></div>

<p>You can specify state-specific variations for one or more of a style's configuration options with a <em>map.</em> 
  For each configuration option, you can specify a list of widget states, along with
the value that option should be assigned when the widget is in that state. </p>


<p>The following example provides for the following variations from a button's normal appearance:
<ul>
<li> when the widget is in the disabled state, the background color should be set to <code>#d9d9d9</code>
<li> when the widget is in the active state (mouse over it), the background color should be set to <code>#ececec</code>
<li> when the widget is in the disabled state, the foreground color should be set to <code>#a3a3a3</code> (this is in addition to the background color change we already noted)
<li> when the widget is in the state where the button is pressed, and the widget is not disabled, the relief should be set to <code>sunken</code>
</ul>
<div class=python><pre>s.map('TButton', 
    background=[('disabled','#d9d9d9'), ('active','#ececec')],
    foreground=[('disabled','#a3a3a3')],
    relief=[('pressed', '!disabled', 'sunken')])</pre></div>

</p>


<div class=fyi><p>Because widget states can contain multiple flags, more than one state may match an option
(e.g., <code>pressed</code> and <code>pressed !disabled</code> will both match if the widget's <code>pressed</code> state flag is set).	The list
of states is evaluated in the order you provide in the map command. The first state in the list that matches is used.</p></div>
