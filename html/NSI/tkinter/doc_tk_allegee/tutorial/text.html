<p>A <b>text</b> widget manages a multi-line text area.  Like the canvas widget, Tk's text widget is
an immensely flexible and powerful tool which can be used for a wide variety of tasks.  It can  
provide a simple multi-line text area as part of a form. But text widgets can also form the basis for a 
stylized code editor, an outliner, a web browser, and much more.</p>
<p>Note: Text widgets are part of the classic Tk widgets, not the themed Tk widgets.</p>


<p class=picture>
<img class='border-0 img-fluid' src='../images/w_textfull_all.png' alt='screen shot'><br />
Text widgets.</p>

<p>While we briefly introduced text widgets in an earlier chapter, we'll go into much more detail here.
You'll get a better sense of the level of sophistication they allow.  Still, for any significant work with 
the text widget, the <a href="../../external.html?link=https://tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TkCmd/text.htm">reference manual</a> is well-organized, useful, and a 
highly-recommended read.</p>



<div class=python><p>Text widgets are created using the <code><b>Text</b></code> class:</p>
	<pre>text = Text(<em>parent</em>, width=40, height=10)</pre></div>

<p>You'll often provide a width (in characters) and height (in lines). As always, you can ask the geometry
  manager to expand it to fill the available space in the window.</p>
  

 <a name="basics"></a><h2>The Basics</h2>

<p>If you simply need a multi-line text field for a form, there are only a few things to worry about: 
  creating and sizing the widget (check), providing an initial value, and retrieving the text after
a user has submitted the form.</p>

<h3>Providing Initial Content</h3>

<p>Text widgets start with nothing in them, so we'll need to add any initial content ourselves.
  Because text widgets can hold a lot more than plain text, a simple mechanism (like the entry widget's
  <code>textvariable</code> configuration option) isn't sufficient.</p>

<p>Instead, we'll use the widget's <code>insert</code> method:</p>

<div class=python><pre>text.insert('1.0', 'here is my\ntext to insert')</pre></div>


<p>The "1.0" here is the position where to insert the text, and can be read as "line 1, character 0".  This
refers to the first character of the first line. Historically, especially on Unix, programmers tend to think about
line numbers as 1-based and character positions as 0-based.</p>

<p>The text to insert is just a string.  Because the widget can hold multi-line text, the string we
supply can be multi-line as well.  To do this, simply embed <code>\n</code> (newline) characters in the
string at the appropriate locations.</p>


<h3>Retrieving the Text</h3>

<p>After users have made any changes and submitted the form (for example), your program can 
retrieve the contents of the widget via the <code>get</code> method:</p>

<div class=python><pre>thetext = text.get('1.0', 'end')</pre></div>


<p>The two parameters are the start and end position; <code>end</code> has the obvious meaning.
  You can provide different start and end positions if you want to obtain only part of the text.
  You'll see more on positions shortly.</p>

<h3>Customizing Appearance</h3>

<p>We previously saw the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> configuration options for text widgets.  
  Several others control its overall appearance. The most useful are:</p>
  
<dl class="row ml-sm-1">
  <dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>foreground</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">color to draw the text in</dd>
  <dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>background</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">background color of the widget</dd>
  <dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>padx, pady</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">extra padding along the inside border of the widget</dd>
  <dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>borderwidth</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">width of the border around widget</dd>
  <dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>relief</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">border style: <code>flat</code>, <code>raised</code>, <code>sunken</code>, <code>solid</code>, <code>ridge</code>, <code>groove</code></dd>
</dl>
  

<h3>Wrapping and Scrolling</h3>

<p>What if some lines of text in the widget are very long, longer than the width of the widget?  By default,
the text wraps around to the next line. This behavior can be changed with the 
<code>wrap</code> configuration option.  It defaults to <code>char</code>, meaning wrap lines at any character.
Other options are <code>word</code> to wrap lines only at
word breaks (e.g., spaces), and <code>none</code> meaning to not wrap lines at all.  In the latter case,
some text of longer lines won't be visible unless we attach a horizontal scrollbar to the widget.
(Users can also scroll through the text using arrow keys, even if scrollbars aren't present).</p>

<p>Scrollbars, both horizontal and vertical, can be attached to the text widget in the 
same way as with other widgets, e.g., canvas, listbox.</p>

<div class=python><pre>t = Text(root, width = 40, height = 5, <b>wrap = "none"</b>)
<b>ys = ttk.Scrollbar(root, orient = 'vertical', command = t.yview)</b>
<b>xs = ttk.Scrollbar(root, orient = 'horizontal', command = t.xview)</b>
<b>t['yscrollcommand'] = ys.set</b>
<b>t['xscrollcommand'] = xs.set</b>
t.insert('end', "Lorem ipsum...\n...\n...")
t.grid(column = 0, row = 0, sticky = 'nwes')
xs.grid(column = 0, row = 1, sticky = 'we')
ys.grid(column = 1, row = 0, sticky = 'ns')
root.grid_columnconfigure(0, weight = 1)
root.grid_rowconfigure(0, weight = 1)
</pre></div>


<p>We can also ask the widget to ensure that a certain part of the text is visible.  For example, let's say
we've added more text to the widget than will fit onscreen (so it will scroll). However, we want to ensure
that the top of the text rather than the bottom is visible. We can use the <code>see</code> method.</p>

<div class=python><pre>text.see('1.0')</pre></div>

<h3>Disabling the Widget</h3>

<p>Some forms will temporarily disable editing in particular widgets unless certain conditions are met 
(e.g., some other options are set to a certain value).  To prevent users from changing
a text widget, set the <code>state</code> configuration option to <code>disabled</code>. Re-enable editing
by setting this option back to <code>normal</code>.</p>

<div class=python><pre>text['state'] = 'disabled'</pre></div>


<div class=fyi><p>As text widgets are part of the classic widgets, the usual <code>state</code> and <code>instate</code>
  methods are not available.</p></div>

 <a name="modifying"></a><h2>Modifying the Text in Code</h2>

<p>While users can modify the text in the text widget interactively, your program can also make
changes.  Adding text is done with the <code>insert</code> method, which we used above to provide an
initial value for the text widget.</p>

<h3>Text Positions and Indices</h3>

<p>When we specified a position of <code>1.0</code> (first line, first character), this was an example of an <em>index</em>.
It tells the <code>insert</code> method where to put the new text (just before the first line, first character, i.e., at the
very start of the widget).  Indices can be specified in a variety of ways. We used another one with the <code>get</code> method:
<code>end</code> means <em>just past</em> the end of the text. (Why "just past?" Text is inserted right
<em>before</em> the given index, so inserting at <code>end</code> will add text to the end of the widget).
Note that Tk will <em>always</em> add a newline at the very end of the text widget.</p>

<p>Here are a few additional examples of indices and how to interpret them:</p>

<dl class="row ml-sm-1">
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>3.end</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">The newline at the end of line 3.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>1.0 + 3 chars</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">Three characters past the start of line 1.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>2.end -1 chars</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">The last character before the new line in line 2.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>end -1 chars</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">The newline that Tk always adds at the end of the text.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>end -2 chars</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">The actual last character of the text.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>end -1 lines</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">The start of the last actual line of text.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>2.2 + 2 lines</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">The third character (index 2) of the fourth line of text.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>2.5 linestart</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">The first character of line 2.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>2.5 lineend</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">The position of the newline at the end of line 2.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>2.5 wordstart</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">First char. of the word with the char. at index 2.5.</dd>
<dt class="col-lg-3 col-xl-2 font-weight-normal"><code>2.5 wordend</code><span class="d-none d-lg-inline">:</span></dt><dd class="col-lg-9 col-xl-10">First char. after the word with the char. at index 2.5.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Some additional things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li> The term <code>chars</code> can be abbreviated as <code>c</code>, and <code>lines</code> as <code>l</code>.
<li> Spaces between terms can be omitted, e.g., <code>1.0+3c</code>.
<li> An index past the end of the text (e.g., <code>end + 100c</code>) is interpreted as <code>end</code>.
<li> Indices wrap to subsequent lines as needed; e.g., <code>1.0 + 10 chars</code> on a line with only five
	 characters will refer to a position on the second line.
<li> Line numbers in indices are interpreted as <em>logical lines,</em> i.e.,
	 each line ends only at the "\n."  With long lines and wrapping enabled, one logical line may represent 
	 multiple <em>display lines</em>. If you'd like to move up or down a single line on the display, you can
	 specify this as, e.g., "1.0 + 2 display lines".
<li> When indices contain multiple words, make sure they are quoted appropriately so that Tk sees
	   the entire index as one argument.
</ul>

<p> To determine the <em>canonical position</em> of an index, use the <code>index <em>idx</em></code> method. Pass it any
	 index expression, and it returns the corresponding index in the form <code><em>line</em>.<em>char</em></code>. For example,
   to find the position of the last character (ignoring the automatic newline at the end), use:</p>
   
<div class=python><pre>text.index('end')</pre></div>

<p> You can compare two indices using the <code>compare</code> method, which lets you check for equality, 
	 whether one index is later in the text than the other, etc.</p>

<div class=python><pre>if text.compare(<em>idx1</em>, "==", <em>idx2</em>"): <em># same position</em></pre></div>

<p>Valid operators are <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, and <code>&gt;=</code>.</p>

<h3>Deleting Text</h3>

<p>While the <code>insert</code> method adds new text anywhere in the widget, the <code>delete <em>start</em> <em>?end?</em></code> method removes it.
We can delete either a single character (specified by index) or a <em>range</em> of characters (specified by 
start and end indices).  In the latter case, characters from (and including) the start index through to <em>just before</em>
the end index will be deleted (so the character at the end index is not deleted).  So if we assume for each of these
we start off with <code>"abcd\nefgh"</code> in the text widget:</p>

<div class=python><pre>text.delete('1.2') <em>&#8658;</em> "abd\nefgh"
text.delete('1.1', '1.2') <em>&#8658;</em> "acd\nefgh"
text.delete('1.0', '2.0') <em>&#8658;</em> "efgh"
text.delete('1.2', '2.1') <em>&#8658;</em> "abfgh"
</pre></div>


<p>There is also a <code>replace</code> method that performs a <code>delete</code> followed by an <code>insert</code> 
  at the same location.</p>


<h3>Example: Logging Window</h3>
<p>Here's a short example that illustrates using a text widget as an 80x24 logging window for an application.
Users don't edit the text widget at all. Instead, the program writes log messages to it.  We'd like
to display more than 24 lines (so no scrolling). If the log is full, old messages are removed from the top
before new ones are added at the end.</p>

<div class=python><pre>from tkinter import *
from tkinter import ttk

root = Tk()
log = Text(root, state='disabled', width=80, height=24, wrap='none')
log.grid()

def writeToLog(msg):
    numlines = int(log.index('end - 1 line').split('.')[0])
    log['state'] = 'normal'
    if numlines==24:
        log.delete(1.0, 2.0)
    if log.index('end-1c')!='1.0':
        log.insert('end', '\n')
    log.insert('end', msg)
    log['state'] = 'disabled'
</pre></div>

<div class=tip><p>Note that because the program placed the widget in a disabled state, we had to re-enable it to make any 
  changes, even from our program.</p></div>



 <a name="tags"></a><h2>Formatting with Tags</h2>

<p>So far, we've used text widgets when all the text is in a single font.  Now it's time to look at how to add special formatting,
such as bold, italic, strikethrough, background colors, font sizes, and much more.  Tk's text widget
implements these using a feature called <em>tags</em>.	</p>

<p>Tags are objects associated with the text widget.  Each tag is referred to via a name chosen by the programmer.
Each tag has several configuration options. These are things like fonts and colors that control formatting.
Though tags are objects having state, they don't need to be explicitly created.
They are automatically created the first time the tag name is used.</p>

<h3>Adding Tags to Text</h3>

<p>Tags can be associated with one or more ranges of text in the widget.  As before, ranges are specified via indices.
A single index represents a single character, and a pair of indices represent a range from the start
character to just before the end character.  Tags are added to a range of text using the 
<code>tag_add</code> method.</p>

<div class=python><pre>text.tag_add('highlightline', '5.0', '6.0')</pre></div>

<p>Tags can also be provided when first inserting text. The <code>insert</code> method supports an optional parameter
containing a list of one or more tags to add to the text being inserted.</p>

<div class=python><pre>text.insert('end', 'new material to insert', ('highlightline', 'recent', 'warning'))</pre></div>

<p>As the text in the widget is modified, whether by a user or your program, the tags will adjust automatically.
For example, if we tagged the text "the quick brown fox" with the tag "nounphrase", and then replaced
the word "quick" with "speedy," the tag still applies to the entire phrase.</p>

<h3>Applying Formatting to Tags</h3>

<p>Formatting is applied to tags via configuration options; these work similarly to configuration options for
the entire widget.  As an example:</p>

<div class=python><pre>text.tag_configure('highlightline', background='yellow', font='TkFixedFont', relief='raised')</pre></div>


<p>Tags support the following configuration options: <code>background</code>, <code>bgstipple</code>, <code>borderwidth</code>, 
<code>elide</code>, <code>fgstipple</code>, <code>font</code>, <code>foreground</code>, <code>justify</code>, <code>lmargin1</code>, <code>lmargin2</code>, 
<code>offset</code>, <code>overstrike</code>, <code>relief</code>, <code>rmargin</code>, <code>spacing1</code>, <code>spacing2</code>, 
<code>spacing3</code>, <code>tabs</code>, <code>tabstyle</code>, <code>underline</code>, and <code>wrap</code>.
Check the reference manual for detailed descriptions of these.  The <code>tag_cget <em>tag</em> <em>option</em></code> method allows us to query the configuration options of a tag.</p>


<p>Because multiple tags can apply to the same range of text, there is the possibility of conflict (e.g., two tags
specifying different fonts).  A priority order is used to resolve these; the most recently created tags have
the highest priority, but priorities can be rearranged using the <code>tag_raise <em>tag</em></code> and <code>tag_lower <em>tag</em></code> 
methods.</p>


<h3>More Tag Manipulations</h3>

<p>To delete one or more tags altogether, we can use the <code>tag_delete <em>tags</em></code> method.  This also, of course, 
removes any references to the tag in the text.  We can also remove a tag from a range of text using the 
<code>tag_remove <em>tag</em> <em>start</em> <em>?end?</em></code> method. 
Even if that leaves no ranges of text with that tag, the tag object itself still exists.</p>

<p>The <code>tag_ranges <em>tag</em></code> method will return a list of ranges in the text that the tag has been applied to.  There
are also <code>tag_nextrange <em>tag</em> <em>start</em> <em>?end?</em></code> and <code>tag_prevrange <em>tag</em> <em>start</em> <em>?end?</em></code> methods to 
search forward or backward for the first such range from a given position.</p>

<p>The <code>tag_names <em>?idx?</em></code> method, called with no additional parameters, will return a list of all tags currently
defined in the text widget (including those that may not be presently used).  If we pass the method an index,
it will return the list of tags applied to just the character at the index.</p>

<p>Finally, we can use the first and last characters in the text having a given tag as indices, the same way we
can use "end" or "2.5".  To do so, just specify <code><em>tagname</em>.first</code> or <code><em>tagname</em>.last</code>.</p>


<h3>Differences between Tags in Canvas and Text Widgets</h3>
<p>Both canvas and text widgets support "tags" that can be applied to several objects, style them, etc.
However, canvas and text tags are not the same.  There are important differences to take note of.</p>

<p>In canvas widgets, only individual canvas items have configuration options that control their appearance.  When we refer
to a tag in a canvas, the meaning of that is identical to "all canvas items presently having that tag."  The tag 
itself doesn't exist as a separate object.  So in the following snippet, the last rectangle added will <em>not</em>
be colored red.  </p>

<div class=python><pre>canvas.itemconfigure('important', fill='red')
canvas.create_rectangle(10, 10, 40, 40, tags=('important'))</pre></div>

<p>In contrast, with text widgets, it's not the individual characters that retain the state information about appearance,
but tags, which are objects in their own right.  So in this snippet, the newly added text <em>will</em> be colored
red.</p>

<div class=python><pre>text.insert('end', 'first text', ('important'))
text.tag_configure('important', foreground='red')
text.insert('end', 'second text', ('important'))</pre></div>


 <a name="bindings"></a><h2>Events and Bindings</h2>

<p>One very cool thing we can do is define event bindings on tags.  That allows us to do things like easily
recognize mouse clicks on particular ranges of text, and popup up a menu or dialog in response.  Different
tags can have different bindings. This saves the hassle of sorting out questions like "what does a click
at this location mean?".  Bindings on tags are implemented using the <code>tag_bind</code> method:</p>

<div class=python><pre>text.tag_bind('important', '&lt;1&gt;', popupImportantMenu)</pre></div>

<p>Widget-wide event bindings continue to work as they do for every other widget, e.g., to capture a mouse click
anywhere in the text.  Besides the normal low-level events, the text widget generates a
<code>&lt;&lt;Modified&gt;&gt;</code> virtual event whenever a change is made to the
content of the widget, and a <code>&lt;&lt;Selection&gt;&gt;</code> virtual event
whenever there is a change made to which text is selected.</p>

 <a name="selection"></a><h2>Selecting Text</h2>

<p>We can identify the range of text selected by a user, if any.  
For example, an editor may have a toolbar button to bold the selected text.  While you can tell when
the selection has changed (e.g., to update whether or not the bold button is active) via the <code>&lt;&lt;Selection&gt;&gt;</code>
virtual event, that doesn't tell you what has been selected.</p>

<p>The text widget automatically maintains a tag named <code>sel</code>, which refers to the selected text.  Whenever the
selection changes, the <code>sel</code> tag will be updated.  So we can find the range of text selected using the
<code>tag_ranges <em>?tag?</em></code> method, passing it <code>sel</code> as the tag to report on.</p>

<p>Similarly, we can change the selection by using <code>tag_add</code> to set a new selection, or <code>tag_remove</code>
to remove the selection.  The <code>sel</code> tag cannot be deleted, however.</p>

<div class=tip><p>Though the default widget bindings prevent this from happening, <code>sel</code> is like any other tag in that it can support
multiple ranges, i.e., disjoint selections.  To prevent this from happening, when changing the selection from your
code, make sure to remove any old selection before adding a new one.</p></div>

<p>The text widget manages the concept of the insertion cursor (where newly typed text will appear) separate from
the selection.  It does so using a new concept called a <em>mark</em>.</p>


 <a name="marks"></a><h2>Marks</h2>

<p>Marks indicate a particular place in the text.  In that respect, they are like indices. However, as
the text is modified, the mark will adjust to be in the same relative location.  In that way, they resemble
tags, but refer to a single position rather than a range of text.  Marks actually don't refer to a position occupied
by a character in the text but specify a position <em>between</em> two characters.</p>

<p>Tk automatically maintains two different marks.  The first, named <code>insert</code>, is the present location of the
insertion cursor.  As the cursor is moved (via mouse or keyboard), the mark moves with it.  The second mark, 
named <code>current</code>, tracks the position of the character underneath the current mouse position.</p>

<p>To create your own marks, use the widget's <code>mark_set <em>name</em> <em>idx</em></code> method, passing it the name of the mark and an index
(the mark is positioned just before the character at the given index).  This is also used to move an existing mark to
a different position.  Marks can be removed using the <code>mark_unset <em>name</em></code> method, passing it the name of the mark.
If you delete a range of text containing a mark, that also removes the mark.</p>

<p>The name of a mark can also be used as an index (in the same way <code>1.0</code> or <code>end-1c</code> are indices).  
You can find the next mark (or previous one) from a given index in the text using the <code>mark_next <em>idx</em></code> or 
<code>mark_previous <em>idx</em></code> methods.  The <code>mark_names</code> method will return a list of the names of all marks.</p>

<p>Marks also have a <em>gravity</em>, which can be modified with the <code>mark_gravity <em>name</em> <em>?direction?</em></code> method, 
which affects what happens when text is inserted at the mark.  Suppose we have the text "ac" with a mark in between that
we'll symbolize with a pipe, i.e., "a|c."   If the gravity of that mark is <code>right</code> (the default), the mark 
attaches itself to the "c."  If the new text "b" is inserted at the mark, the mark will remain stuck to the "c,"
and so the new text will be inserted before the mark, i.e., "ab|c."  If the gravity is instead <code>left</code>, the mark
attaches itself to the "a," and so new text will be inserted after the mark, i.e., "a|bc."</p>


 <a name="images"></a><h2>Images and Widgets</h2>

<p>Like canvas widgets, text widgets can contain not only text but also images and any other Tk widgets (including a frame, itself
containing many other widgets).  In a sense, this allows the text widget to work as a geometry manager in its own right.
The ability to add images and widgets within the text opens up a world of possibilities for your program.</p>

<p>Images are added to a text widget at a particular index, with the image specified as an existing Tk image.  
Other options that allow you to fine-tune padding, etc.</p>

<div class=python><pre>flowers = PhotoImage(file='flowers.gif')
text.image_create('sel.first', image=flowers)</pre></div>

<p>Other widgets are added to a text widget in much the same way as images.  The widget
being added must be a descendant of the text widget in the widget hierarchy.</p>

<div class=python><pre>b = ttk.Button(text, text='Push Me')
text.window_create('1.0', window=b)</pre></div>


 <a name="more"></a><h2>Even More</h2>

<p>Text widgets can do many more things. Here, we'll briefly mention just a few more of them.  
  For details on any of these, see the reference manual.</p>

<h3>Search</h3>

<p>The text widget includes a powerful <code>search</code> method that allows you to locate a piece of text within the 
widget. This is useful for a "Find" dialog, as one obvious example.  You can search backward or forward from a
particular position or within a given range, specify the search term using exact text, case insensitive, or via
regular expressions, find one or all occurrences of the search term, etc.</p>

<h3>Modifications, Undo and Redo</h3>

<p>The text widget keeps track of whether changes have been made to the text (useful to know whether it needs to be
saved to a file, for example). We can query (or change) using the <code>edit_modified <em>?bool?</em></code> method.  There is also
a complete multi-level undo/redo mechanism, managed automatically by the widget when we set its <code>undo</code> 
configuration option to <code>true</code>.  Calling <code>edit_undo</code> or <code>edit_redo</code> modifies the current
text using information stored on the undo/redo stack.</p>

<h3>Eliding Text</h3>

<p>Text widgets can include text that is not displayed. This is known as "elided" text, and is made
available using the <code>elide</code> configuration option for tags.  It can be used to implement
an outliner, a "folding" code editor, or even to bury extra meta-data intermixed with displayed text.
When specifying positions within elided text, you have to be a bit more careful. Methods that work with
positions have extra options to either include or ignore the elided text.</p>

<h3>Introspection</h3>

<p>Like most Tk widgets, the text widget goes out of its way to expose information about its internal state. We've
seen this in terms of the <code>get</code> method, widget configuration options, <code>names</code> and
<code>cget</code> for both tags and marks, etc.  There is even more information available that can be useful
for a wide variety of tasks.  Check out the <code>debug</code>, <code>dlineinfo</code>, <code>bbox</code>, 
<code>count</code>, and <code>dump</code> methods in the reference manual.</p>

<h3>Peering</h3>

<p>The Tk text widget allows the same underlying text data structure (containing all the text, marks, tags, images, etc.) to be
shared between two or more different text widgets.  This is known as <em>peering</em> and is controlled via the
<code>peer</code> method.</p>
